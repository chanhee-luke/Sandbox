the experience of down syndrome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood .
and a lot of the time the question of parenthood is , what do we validate in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won 't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove , so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?

i get a sense of anticipation " ?
i 'm watching your faces very carefully .
that 's not the expression of joy .
this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people , and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face .
and i feel that here .
so i have to work with a supply chain , and i 've got to work with the technologies , and i 've got to work with everything else all the time , and so compromises start to fit into it .

they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
and they tend to be on their own .
they are multinational , as i say , they are branded , they have a clear identity , so they don 't get lost in a busy world .
science and just observation gives us that feeling without it , so i don 't feel the need .
they 've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement .
i have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting , literally at times , their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe .

everybody thought the answer is , send things to india and china .
if you really care about books , you 're going to scan them better , especially if they 're valuable books .

and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we 've done that for thousands of years .

well , these bees hang out at that hole , and they wait for that mother to fly away , they go in , eat the egg , and lay their own egg there . so they don 't do any work .

here 's another crowd in mecca .
those words are by rick warren .

we were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young , brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds .

we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case , so we take a carrot cake , put it in a blender , and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice , and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream , i guess , and it comes off looking like , you know , jupiter 's floating around your plate .

creationists , lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case , fall back on the popular phobia against atheism .
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can 't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex , thereby simply compounding the problem .
now , there 's a typical scientific journal , the quarterly review of biology .
as has been said before , we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in . some of us just go one god further .
but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group , namely , top scientists .
so , what other words might be used to smooth the path , oil the wheels , sugar the pill ? darwin himself preferred " agnostic " -- and not only out of loyalty to his friend huxley , who coined the term .
the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .
my god is a little god , and i want him to stay that way . ' a religion , old or new , that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths . "
it 's just been industrial , which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars , and later , more for the telegraph , and the radio transmitter , and the television , and eventually the mainframe .
and she 'll come to encarta , one of the main online encyclopedias .
but what we 're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
instead of building well-behaved appliances -- things that you know what they 'll do in advance -- you begin to build more open tools . there 's a new set of values , a new set of things people value .
while it is true that those things are going on , there 's an africa that you don 't hear about very much .
a study by the economic commission for africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 african countries .
we put together a program that would , one : get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in .
we de-linked that , and once we did it , we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price .
and it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
there 's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children 's lives . that 's not what i 'm saying . that is fine .

the invader draws the attention of the immune system 's front-line troops .
it was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
it 's like , as many times as the virus changes its clothes , it 's still wearing the same socks , and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks .
so if this works in humans , what we 're talking about is a universal flu vaccine , one that doesn 't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death .
so , dan [ barber ] , if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm , i know where to get them .
so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments , we will master these and new tools of vaccinology , and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives .
and malaria 's even further behind ?
education is the main event that can happen in cities .
that 's the cheetah generation , and africa 's salvation rests on the backs of these cheetahs .
look at africa 's begging-bowl .
i asked them to name me just 20 .

it also means that he will be able to generate wealth .
but there 's this shift in how information is flowing online , and it 's invisible .

it gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
we need it to connect us all together .
she took our order , and then went to the couple in the booth next to us , and she lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying .
i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it .
those of you who are good at branding , i 'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people .
once it becomes a closed system , with u.s. participation , then everybody who 's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation ?
and now i mainly write books about how the ocean is changing , and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly .
they can 't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn 't one in their community .
and so you can see , literally , signs of their shock , signs of their outrage , signs of their anger , and signs of their grief .
these guys have to swim around through it .
they 're probably having , at the very least , a catastrophic spawning season this year .
and we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do .
in fact , really what i think they should do , if anything -- they 're trying so hard to protect those nests -- actually , if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave , and that would be better for them this year .
and even though the police can be a little annoying at times -- giving us tickets and stuff like that -- nobody says that we should just get rid of them .
who says it 's too expensive ?
and i assembled this in my garage , and it now lives in the physics department of the university of nevada , reno .
that 's why we look different .
its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons .
so let 's meet bobby kasthuri , who works in the laboratory of jeff lichtman at harvard university .
according to this self-help book , guys brains are like waffles ; they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes .
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite ?
and there 's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts , feelings and perceptions , our mental experiences .
well , i propose a direct test .
sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication .
sebastian seung : i am my connectome
as we were talking , roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side .
ks : so i 'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal , it 's not a magnetic material . but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube .

that 's serendipitous .
three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation .
unfortunately , over the past quarter century , epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have .
they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel .
our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call " institutional acupuncture . "
integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry .
and this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams .
for example , our over-centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy-shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack .
this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges -- climate change , nuclear proliferation , energy insecurity , energy poverty -- all of which make us less safe .
and as i went village to village , i remember one day , when i was famished and exhausted , and i was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
these are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
i don 't know .
there is things to see , there is the big challenge .
that is our poetry . that is our beautiful story .
it 's ok . you start to be in the territory of intelligence , we can say .
this line of evolution is clearly positive .

designer philippe starck -- with no pretty slides to show -- spends 18 minutes reaching for the very roots of the question " why design ? " listen carefully for one perfect mantra for all of us , genius or not .
when i get six- and seven-year-olds in a group , i have to figure out how to keep them quiet .

and if the person doing it , whether it 's the mother or grandmother , whoever 's doing it , that is when the education process begins .
i have my entire new york city board of education transcript from kindergarten through college .
but it begins with the gift of a good start .

i 'd come out of my suite at the waldorf astoria — — be walking up the street , and i would hit around 55th street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler .
reputations are volatile . loyalties are fickle .
the ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy .
for the true selves of companies to come through , openness is paramount , but radical openness is not a solution , because when everything is open , nothing is open .
in fact , people were extremely frustrated .
i still remember the photo .

i was detained on the 27th night .
we are going to win because we don 't understand politics .

bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them , one after the other , depending on who they 're speaking to .
the social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics .
an image is worth more than a thousand words , so i 'm going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that i recently captured .
so we had this speaker set up , and we had the camera facing it , and lots of lights pointing at the speaker , and i would set up the speaker , put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker , and we would do this over and over again , and it was until midday that i realized that i had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker .

may we actualize that capacity for women everywhere .
now , it 's no surprise that when you add consecutive fibonacci numbers , you get the next fibonacci number . right ?
together , they form a one-by-two rectangle .
then there was aron kader , who was the palestinian-american .
he goes , " what is your grandfather 's name ? "

they sat in silence through their trails , waving occasionally at family and friends .
i 'll give you an idea .

and then that story changed .
i couldn 't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me .
you 're like the raspyni brothers , where you 've got your balls in cold water . and -- -- you just play with your fingers all day . and then you get invited .
child-prodigy piano player , he started on the squeezebox , and moved to a little more serious issue , a bigger instrument , and now to an even larger instrument , upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic , as you see here .
and then they hopped in it , turned the little electronic key , rather than the real key , zipped home on their new superhighway , and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle .
the computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine , a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes , at a moment 's notice , because the computer is just a machine .
looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside .
it 's all about sensuality . it 's all about transforming .
boo hewerdine , thomas dolby , thank you very much for inviting me . it 's been a blessing singing for you .
when i was nine , i saw the movie " jaws , " and thought to myself , " no , thank you . "
my saying was going to be , " i 'm taking out the trash ! "
i didn 't want to tell my grandmother about it because i was scared i 'd get in trouble for playing somewhere i shouldn 't have been .

i hope you guys recognize it .
the western border of the boreal in british columbia is marked by the coast mountains , and on the other side of those mountains is the greatest remaining temperate rainforest in the world , the great bear rainforest , and we 'll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail .
this is one section of one mining complex , and there are about another 40 or 50 in the approval process .
and of course , these tailings ponds -- well , you can 't see many ponds from outer space and you can see these , so maybe we should stop calling them ponds -- these massive toxic wastelands are built unlined and on the banks of the athabasca river .
this is a globally significant wetland , perhaps the greatest on the planet .
we need to ensure that these wetlands and forests that are our best and greatest and most critical defense against global warming are protected , and we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere .
she also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures , often of animals , which she then completely covers in bindis , often with potent symbolism .
he creates these opulent tableaus inspired by hieronymus bosch , but also by the kashmiri textiles of his youth .
i 'm an ecologist , and i study complexity . i love complexity .
the circled node is the one we 're trying to influence -- popular support for the government .
and i think you should do something unusual with them , because these are bonus minutes . you weren 't going to have them anyway .
for many people , this means , i wish i 'd spent more time with my family , with my kids when they were growing up .
now the concussion didn 't heal properly , and after 30 days i was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches , nausea , vertigo , memory loss , mental fog .
now it wasn 't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms .
i feel closer to my friends and family .
all right , i like the people doing both . you are overachievers .
sloth , giraffe , elephant , snake . okay , let 's see what we got .
so this is true .
and it 's a project that we 've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
i laughed and said , " well we 've only just started it , you can have a little bit of it . "
so the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic , ever-evolving creature , that 's actually gone way beyond christine and i.
mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist .
now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative .
here is this diagram in crochetness .
but we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three , increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code , the models immediately started to look more natural .
and the play tank , like the think tank , is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas .
and if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can 't see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
he 'll say , " doctor , this is not fifi . it looks exactly like fifi , but it 's some other dog . " right ?
but maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
so this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
it sounds like an oxymoron .
ok ? what you do is you create what i call a mirror box .
he closes his eyes .
but the problem is i still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn 't reach . "
why does this happen ?
remember i said it runs in families ?
one of them is kiki , one of them is buba .
it 's kind of a well-kept secret .
and i think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
what 's more , they are able to walk upright for long distances .
you 're happy .
realizing that nyota might get hurt , panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tugs to get the scissors back .
now she comes up to dr. sue and starts writing again .
so we want to create an environment in which bonobos , like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun , and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them .
we 're learning how to become like them .
if we go beyond our solar system , we 've learned that the stars aren 't twinkly points of light .
stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together .
it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us .
he wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits . now , that 's absurdly naive for two reasons .
so we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our earth and beyond .
some journeyed to the moons and planets .
it turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing .
they said , " yes . "
it didn 't make them less happy , it just didn 't do much for them .
maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
they ask people , " did you donate money to charity recently ? "
the reason i have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata , and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that .
they post projects , so they say , " i want to teach huckleberry finn to my class and we don 't have the books , " or " i want a microscope to teach my students science and we don 't have a microscope . "
they 're today 's iranian jews , still 25,000 of them living in iran , making them the largest jewish community in the middle east outside of israel itself .
the easiest target was the peace process , and now the iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite , and iran began supporting extensively palestinian islamist groups that it previously had shunned .
but rather than making war inevitable by viewing this as ideological , we would be wise to seek ways to make peace possible .
this is u.k. government data , a completely independent site , where does my money go .
you can see europe is ablaze with updates .
there are two elections every election cycle in lesterland .
really .05 percent ?
i don 't mean rod blagojevich sense of corruption .
because there is an economy here , an economy of influence , an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization .
if the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of america , the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of americans , to spread it out , to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone .
okay . but even if you 're not yet with me , even if you believe this is impossible , what the five years since i spoke at ted has taught me as i 've spoken about this issue again and again is , even if you think it 's impossible , that is irrelevant .
a government dependent upon the people alone .
it provoked the missile gap .
when i was 16 in san francisco , i had my breakthrough manic episode in which i thought i was jesus christ .
some of them committed suicide .
so i didn 't expect that , but -- i mean , i expected you could synchronize .
we 're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony .
as i say , if you 're in a swarm , your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group .
and the message , as you can imagine , is " come hither . mate with me . "
you don 't have to be alive . you don 't have to be even a single cell .
so i 'm going to give them a chance to do that .
yeah , it felt unstable , and it was very windy , and i remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides , so you could definitely -- there was something going on sideways , it felt , maybe .
now , you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome , but after all , we do walk like -- i mean , we oscillate back and forth as we walk .
allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge who wrote to me , suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge -- provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length .
and he described the diversity within crops -- all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such -- as a genetic resource .
and i want to give you an example of that .
it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine .
and you can see that there 's some difference between one growing season and another .
so , a number of us got together and decided that , you know , enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of -- maybe not the most charismatic diversity .
in this place there .
there are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it .
blogging affects your posture . we start with the posture .
i guess in plural it 's scrotal , like medium and media .
and i feel very strongly that it 's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it 's ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it .
and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation .
40 years long , with an overlap . you can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies . the interesting thing -- by the way , the speed here , excuse me , higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles . there is none here .
i can 't tell you when this will start , because i don 't want my competition to know my schedule .
the military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the sr71 . it went a whole life cycle , got too rusty to fly , and was taken out of service . the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel .
but anyway , i think we need to beat them again .
the internet is becoming a giant global computer , and every time you go on it , you upload a video , you do a google search , you remix something , you 're programming this big global computer that we all share .
now , what is openness ?
you know , conventional wisdom says talent is inside , right ?
they 'd better be good .
the pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets in a commons . they need to start sharing precompetitive research .
well , these wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum , and politics abhors a vacuum , and unsavory forces can fill that , typically the old regime , or extremists , or fundamentalist forces .
the internet enables each of us to be a producer .
and imagine , just consider this idea , if you would : what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass ?
so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time .
so the body 's ability to balance angiogenesis , when it 's working properly , prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers .
we have about a 60 percent response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized .
so i went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking : could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis , beating cancer at its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous ?
but what 's very cool is when we actually combined the two less potent teas together , the combination , the blend , is more potent than either one alone .
and for many people around the world , dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments , but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local , sustainable , antiangiogenic crops .
william li : so there are antiangiogenic treatments that are fda approved , and if you 're a cancer patient or working for one or advocating for one , you should ask about them .
so , very first puzzle , sixth grade , my teacher said , " oh , let 's see , that guy , he likes to make stuff .
well , i take everyday problems , and i make puzzles out of them .
originally i tried to do the words " figure " and " ground . "
well , let 's first of all simplify the vases illusion , make the thing on the right .
well , move the blue one out of the way .
cut up the dna , you sequence individual pieces , and then you look for overlaps , and you basically match them at the edges . and i said , " this is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle , except the pieces overlap . "
first of all , you know , for a long time computer games meant things like " doom , " where you 're going around shooting things , very violent games , very fast , aimed at teenage boys . right ? that 's who plays computer games .
and we decided to combine our skills .
and i 've been thinking a lot about what i have learned over these last particularly 11 years with v-day and " the vagina monologues , " traveling the world , essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women .
i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo .
i know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .
but i also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24 , they are they key , really , in the developing world , as well as in the whole world , to the future of humanity .
it 's my baby and it 's full of love . "

in the investigation that followed before the actual trial , each of the other five teenagers was shown photographs , the same photo array .
it was those two considerations , among others -- reconstructed memory , the fact about the eyewitness fallibility -- that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal attorneys led by an amazing lawyer named ellen eggers to pool their experience and their talents together and petition a superior court for a retrial for francisco carrillo .
and here i became a bit audacious , and i turned and i asked the judge , i said , " your honor , i think you should go out and look at the scene yourself . "
and this is three to four feet away .
all our memories are reconstructed memories .
now , mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down , you measure a longer and longer length .
and it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle , and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here .
and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this .
and finally , the fractals have self-similarity -- so they 're similar to themselves , but they 're not necessarily similar to each other -- you see very different uses for fractals .
anywhere you go in the sahel , you 'll see this windscreen .
and i started explaining why i was there in africa , and they got very excited when they saw the cantor set .
so all these little pdas and laptops -- every digital circuit in the world -- started in africa .
so we need to think about , as was spoken earlier , the traditional african methods for doing self-organization .
so how can we change this dynamic ?
in 1983 , jeff sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in new england .
so on the morning i visited , eleanor came downstairs , poured herself a cup of coffee , sat in a reclining chair , and she sat there , kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs , checked the list , made themselves breakfast , checked the list again , put the dishes in the dishwasher , rechecked the list , fed the pets or whatever chores they had , checked the list once more , gathered their belongings , and made their way to the bus .
our kids love this process .
we have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus or other family experts .
so plank number one : adapt all the time .
and started counting , and within 10 seconds it had ended .
we are travelers , not tourists .
each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way . "
they stood together under a tree in tall grass on tv telling the world their story we will be left to wander and fade away soldiers came and took our husbands at the break of day we will live on then fade away soldiers came and killed our children at the break of day women of hope women of change women of war and pain i believe i believe the almighty knows each and every one of you by your name women of hope women of change women of love , joy , no shame you 've got something this little life can never take away running through the darkness of night with a child by her side oh lord , won 't you give them a shining armor of light oh lord , won 't you give them a shining armor of light daybreak brings a sign of new life with the power to stand crossing the border she said , " you will grow free on this land " women of hope women of change women of war and pain i can feel your power in these words she said if you 're feeling helpless help someone if you 're feeling helpless help someone nobody really knows how far they will go to keep on living nobody really knows how far they will go to keep on giving and forgiving aung san suu kyi living under house arrest for her peaceful protest under house arrest for her peaceful protest when her people asked her for a message she said if you 're feeling helpless help someone if you 're feeling helpless help someone if you 're feeling helpless help someone if you 're feeling helpless help someone now we know the words , let 's sing .
and it 's not just water that this works with .
and i 'm going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small .
sobule : hillary supported the war . sweeney : even thomas friedman supported the war . sobule : colin powell turned out to be ... together : ... such a pussy . sobule : william faulkner , drunk and depressed , tennessee williams , drunk and depressed . sweeney : yeah .
his name was nikola , nikola tesla .
tesla has over 700 patents to his name : radio , wireless telegraphy , remote control , robotics .
thank you .
so when these neurons are in the motor circuit , you get dysfunction in the movement system , and you get things like parkinson 's disease .
so we now know how to find these troublemakers and tell them , " gentlemen , that 's enough .
this has been one of the most satisfying cases that i have ever done in my entire career , to restore movement and walking to this kind of child .
so what we 've decided to do is we 're going to try to turbocharge we 're going to place electrodes within the circuits that regulate your memory and cognitive function to see if we can turn up their activity .
so the message i want to leave you with today is that , indeed , there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states , whether we 're talking about parkinson 's disease , depression , schizophrenia , alzheimer 's .
so , the answer is bio-mimicry : just copy nature directly .
and they asked us this question . they say , " why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane , when you 're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane ? " this is a good question .
it just bends by itself beautifully .
this is a graduate student . this is what he 's doing to his thesis project -- very robust , if a graduate student does that to his thesis project .
here 's the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
and if you blow that up , and zoom in 900 times , you see there are hairs there , tiny hairs . and if you look carefully , those tiny hairs have striations . and if you zoom in on those 30,000 times , you 'll see each hair has split ends .
but the ants do , and we 'll figure out why , so that ultimately we 'll make this move . and imagine : you 're going to be able to have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around .
a couple of years ago , i was in new york , and i was pitching a deal , and i was in one of those fancy new york private equity offices you can picture .
and my daughter , who 's three , when i dropped her off at preschool , did that whole hugging-the-leg , crying , " mommy , don 't get on the plane " thing .
and we walk out , and we look at each other , and we say , " how did you do ? "
there 's a really good study that shows this really well .
she said , " well , you 're giving this talk , and you said you were going to take two more questions .
and she starts thinking about having a child , and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child , she starts thinking about making room for that child .
i think a world that was run where half of our countries and half of our companies were run by women , would be a better world .
when people don 't take their pills , when people don 't follow doctors ' orders -- these are behavior problems .
they would get dentures , and if you got dentures , you weren 't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob , you 'll eat mush for the rest of your life .
this is still the way we 're communicating messages about health .
you 've seen them all around , especially these days as radars are cheaper .
and then we turn the page of the magazine , and we see this -- now this is the page the fda requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads , or to follow their ads , and to me , this is one of the most cynical exercises in medicine .
and so i came up with this : lab test results .
but you don 't have to wade through it . you don 't have to go through the junk .
in this case it 's about 25 percent , based on that .
this is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people .
and one of the things i really like about gardening is that it doesn 't take all your concentration , you really can 't get hurt -- it 's not like woodworking -- and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation .
and that 's what the lawn was .
but , you know , there 's a comedian who said , " well , who 's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important ?
this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia .
and third , while they 're in this paddock they are , of course , defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field .
it 's a remarkably hopeful thing to do .
they 're not very well designed , right ?
it 's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go .
that 's a really scary thought , that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully .
so this is one of the most famous game dynamics .
it can be used in interesting ways .
and communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems .
let 's all build it together , let 's do it well and have fun playing .
there 's a lot of activity in china .
now , each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own .
audience : orkut .
and -- well , i 'll leave you in suspense .
and i don 't know about all of you , but i have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once .
and we didn 't like that , so we actually , in maybe a couple of weeks , we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors , and so we can leave them on all the time and they 're completely silent .
and so we use our over 150,000 advertisers and millions of advertisements , so we pick the one that 's most relevant to what you 're actually looking at , much as we do on search .
he was just kind of writing about his life .
it 's a woodworking machine , or at least a piece of one , and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern , a little bit easier to use .
and to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made , which meant building long viaducts across river valleys -- this is actually the viaduct across the thames at maidenhead -- and long tunnels such as the one at box , in wiltshire .
what makes technology useful and usable ?
and instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers , they used low-cost cad / cam prototyping technology .
now the industrial systems of brunel 's time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
so for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career .
in response , he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sticking to their guns , regardless of what other people want or recommend .
the assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others .
of course , you and i know that coke is the better choice .
it 's not a marker of liberation , but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae .
in france , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed , while in the united states , the final decision rested with the parents .
but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn 't always work out that way .
and so one time i was in a beauty salon , and i was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink .
sheena iyengar studies how we make choices -- and how we feel about the choices we make . at tedglobal , she talks about both trivial choices and profound ones , and shares her groundbreaking research that has uncovered some surprising attitudes about our decisions .
so i built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front , and i was trying to pull something very long and heavy , so that 's a four-meter-long object just to pull , and i was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder , i could control four meters of absorbent .
we went from a back rudder to a front rudder to two rudders to multiple rudders to the whole boat changing shape , and the more we are moving forward , and the more the design looks simple and cute .
it means that everybody is free to use , modify and distribute , and in exchange we only ask for two things : the name is credited -- the name of the project -- and also the people who make improvement , they share back with the community .
so imagine yourself .
girl 2 : and then you can download onto your ipod .
by the year 2000 , the process was perfected . they merged with aol , and in just four years , managed to shed about 200 billion dollars of market capitalization , showing that they 'd actually mastered the art of applying moore 's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet .
and on the right-hand side , there 's a scale that shows the rocket 's velocity .
there 's an interesting marketing lesson from it , which is basically , when you market a product , you can either say , this is going to be wonderful , it will make you feel better and enliven you .
a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they 're quite certain that television is about to do them in .
but we will discuss this scandal , because this man , jack berry , the host of " winky dink , " went on to become the host of " twenty one , " one of the most important quiz shows ever .
and when i say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations , it 's not just a joke about messianism , it 's actually what we do .
meanwhile , in california , we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff .
the pyramids , the colosseum , the new york subway system and tv dinners , ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all .
voice 2 : next on the gourmet pet channel , decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer .
and then you have tv guide , a fox property , which is about to sponsor the online video awards -- but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television , not appearing to gloat .
here 's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones , powered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page -- user-generated content married up with traditional content .
and i used three criteria : the first was , i thought i 'd talk about real design within reach , design that 's free , not design not quite within reach , as we 're fondly known by our competition and competitors , but stuff that you can find on the streets , stuff that was free , stuff that was available to all people , and stuff that probably contains some other important messages .
and , approaching a building from a distance , you don 't see too much ; you get a little closer , and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a mondrian or a diebenkorn or something .
color can animate simple blocks , simple materials : walking in new york , i 'll stop .
i walk to work every day or ride my scooter , and i come down and park in this little spot .
but i think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas .
of course i always wondered what would happen if he 'd kissed the airplane first .
so it had to be self-righting , and stay up without crashing .
and i started up a very small operation -- went from 40 people to one , in an effort to rediscover my innocence .
so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn 't have to fuss with it .
i had one for a wristwatch once . 20 pages .
and that 's a lot of load .
and i did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people .
and let 's assume you 're bitten by a mosquito that 's carrying that virus .
once you 've got the mosquito in your area , anyone coming into that area with dengue , mosquito will bite them , mosquito will bite somewhere else , somewhere else , somewhere else , and you 'll get an epidemic .
we don 't want to have a lasting impact on the environment .
and if you can put more , i 'll call them sterile , that the offspring will actually die at different stages , but i 'll call them sterile for now .
and for brazil , where we 've been doing some trials , the brazilian government themselves have now built their own mosquito factory , far bigger than ours , and we 'll use that for scaling up in brazil .
i found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
and if you 're like me , you 're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
so , what 's wrong with this picture ?
if you really studied that you might have some clues as to what paul likes to do .
with that , i would like to just say that jack lord said this almost 10 years ago .
their name in your inbox -- it 's all you wanted anyway .
you don 't say a prayer .
before going further , let me give you a crash course in plant biology .
some are happier than others .
phosphorus , a nutrient essential to life , which is becoming increasingly scarce , yet nobody is talking about it .
do we have a solution , or an alternative which will allow us to optimize phosphorus use ?
true symbiosis .
mycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years , and it has even helped modern-day plant species to diversify .
the end of the 19th century , beginning of the 20th century , and how that hanging chain model translates into archways and vaulting .
the elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting , they 're all losing their modular quality , and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions .
because we 're using escalators to move people , all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads .
so , for me , what was important is that this coffee set -- which is just a coffee pot , a teapot , and those are the pots sitting on a tray -- that they would have a coherence -- so , they would be greg lynn alessi coffee pots -- but that everyone who bought one would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way .
about six years ago , i bought one of these cnc mills , to just replace , kind of , young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models .
let 's come back again a few years later , here in 2003 , and we 'll see that that landscape actually looks a lot more like iowa than it does like a rainforest .
well , the colorado on a typical day in the 1950s , this is just , you know , not a flood , not a drought , kind of an average day , it looks something like this .
the soviet union didn 't really have a sierra club .
it 's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world .
this is work that we 're doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment .
and we all need food .
surprisingly , agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change .
it 's built over the lagoon , and there are no streets where there can be stores to shop , and so the store comes to you .
but governments hate the diy economy , and that 's why -- i took this picture in 2007 , and this is the same market in 2009 -- and i think , when the organizers of this conference were talking about radical openness , they didn 't mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone .
this is an ad for mtn , which is a south african multinational active in about 25 countries , and when they came into nigeria — nigeria is the big dog in africa .
so it 's very important to them to track piracy exactly because of this , and the people who are buying , the pirates , are not their customers anyway , because their customers want the real deal .
i mean , the functional impairment is clear .
every time you contract a muscle , it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis .
when you lose your arm , that nervous system still works .
on the left side he 's got a modern motorized prosthesis with those three joints , and he operates little pads in his shoulder that he touches to make the arm go .
and after a few months , you touch jesse on his chest , and he felt his missing hand .
ak : well , it was a little difficult , because all i had to work with was a bicep and a tricep .
and the most important thing is our patients have appreciated it .
so we 've developed a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back and is operating this all by the way she trains it to use her individual muscle signals .
tk : that hand 's not so good for clapping .
so rather than a super strong or super fast arm , we 're making an arm that is -- we 're starting with , the 25th percentile female -- that will have a hand that wraps around , opens all the way , two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow .
she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she 'd received during the trial , or even what the trial had been about .
now , in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable , participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand , and must freely consent to participate in the trial .
if , for any reason , they feel that this might not be possible , then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place .
we 're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions .
and that 's what i came to study .
that means that there 's no upwelling , and there 's basically no food .
this is one of the plights of penguins : oil pollution .
i 'm just going to talk about two things .
he met us and got his name because he started standing under my diesel truck : a turbo truck , so we named him turbo .
here 's a female that 's in a hurry . she 's got food .
but let 's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born .
let 's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world , eastern eurasia .
that 's larger than the entire population of russia .
then there is trade .
all of this is happening without firing a shot .
and therefore it has to have amicable relations with them .
now i know some of you may be thinking , " oil , oil , oil .
the european union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries , and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of germany to happen in a peaceful way .
so what 's next ? where are we going to see borders change and new countries born ?
now we fear changes on the map .
so we started to change genes at random , looking for long-lived animals .
it 's the same age , but it 's not in the nursing home ; it 's going skiing .
so it 's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself , speeding up aging .
and what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations -- that is , changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for igf-1 .
and the immune system is more active .
and they all come and they fortify the house .
it is a drug for people , but the reason is it suppresses the immune system .
ck : there are . there are some animals that don 't seem to age .
what controls aging ? biochemist cynthia kenyon has found a simple genetic mutation that can double the lifespan of a simple worm , c. elegans . the lessons from that discovery , and others , are pointing to how we might one day significantly extend youthful human life .
and i 'll give you an example : the now magazine from last week -- progressive , downtown weekly in toronto .
but most importantly , it 's voluntary .
we can reform our electoral systems .
now , an emerging view that you also heard about from dr. insel this morning , is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion , mood and affect .
so how do we ask this question ?
there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation .
but it could equally be the case that it 's the learning disabilities that cause the hyperactivity .
in fact , there 's only one good thing i can think of when it gets to mosquitos .
in contrast , the african malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person , and that of course we should have known all along because they 're called mosqui-toes , you see ?
ooh , that was very quick .
now , on the video , on the video here , i 'm going to show you exactly the same thing , except that what i 'm showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tablet .
as the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant .
now just about that time , the practice of surgery evolved from big to small , from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures , tiny incisions .
if this research is successful , it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .
there are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .
disrespect , boredom , too much time on facebook , having sex with other people .
one of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work , the more attractive his wife will find him .
and theoretically , i suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash , we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we 've got it pretty good .
so we have to keep an eye on that .
in this simulation , each black dot is one nerve cell .
this experiment revealed the first , and perhaps most fundamental , nugget of the neural code : that information is written in the form of electrical impulses .
so in this cartoon , the bluish white cell in the upper-left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light-activated pore .
we cope with this pressure by having brains , and within our brains , decision-making centers that i 've called here the " actor . "
here 's what happened in two instances : we 're comparing two strains of flies , each of them having about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains , shown here in green on the left and on the right .
now consider a situation in which the motors stay off , the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped .
take control of your health and get on with your life . "
they 're not approved to do this . patients are not approved to do this .
tb : many people after a kidney transplant will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney .
now the smartphones that we 're already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them , and a whole array of others , today , and as sensing is built into these , we 'll be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like we 've never had before .
i should have been happy , because i was so well that i could go back to my normal doctors , but i wept because i was so actually connected to this team .
now it took about two weeks of processing on intel 's highest-end servers to make this happen , and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data .
i define that as an association between biology and another discipline , where each discipline reciprocally advances the other , but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field .
so you 're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko .
so of course , in reality , we were then panicked , being the biologists , and we should know this already .
so here is normal speed .
and we 're going to attempt the first air-righting response in a tail , with a robot .
so then we wondered , " can they actually maneuver with this ? "
so to conclude , i think we need to build biomutualisms , like i showed , that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application .
you know , they were marginalized in the negotiation room .
that changes our climate .
one day where we had calm seas and sun , which was the reason i could get off the ship .
now , there 's 40 scientists working on this project , and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses .
we 've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount .
this coral is eight meters tall , right .
we know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year .
some of them show greater variability .
so one of the things we 're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells .
this particular idea , however -- although we don 't yet know whether it 's right or wrong , and at the end i 'll discuss experiments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it 's right or wrong -- this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research .
that is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
now , but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded , two questions immediately arise from his observation .
so many people worked on it , but by the ' 40s , certainly by the ' 50s , this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away .
it 's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies .
this is a deep question .
and we think -- and this is , i think , very exciting -- that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions .
i want to start with a game .
and instead of telling you , i 'll just show you .
so how on earth do we even see ?
now i want you to look at that dot between the green and the red . okay ?
and see what happens to your perception .
move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye .
and they land on the flower . they stick their tongue in there , called a proboscis , and they drink sugar water .
on the left is what his camera sees .
so , if we have the lights down .
and what i want to do in this talk is to split them apart -- figuring out when they diverge and how they converge .
imagine a rabbit in a field , eating grass , and the rabbit 's going to see a fox .
and the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don 't control .
and the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack , they get different .
if , for example , terrorism almost never happens , it 's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures .
we get them from religion , from culture , teachers , elders .
we change light bulbs without even thinking about it .
i think it depends on the observer .
we can do to the next harvest .
one , you can fix people 's feelings , directly appeal to feelings .
as a homework assignment , think of 10 ways to get around it .
if , after i come back , this marshmallow is here , you will get another one . so you will have two . "
a great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow , they were in trouble .
so this has applications in all walks of life .
and at the end of the meeting , we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project ; most people wanted to tear it down .
we opened the fist section in 2009 .
thanks .
and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them .
we need military presence , but we need to move to politics .
the arab spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter .
there 's a big array of the ways of dealing with this .
we know from our personal experiences that it 's easy sometimes just to walk , and sometimes you may need to fight .
but the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it .
actually , technically , it 's not a rectum . it 's called a cloaca .
and , one thing that isn 't a mystery , actually , was when i grew up -- because when i was a little kid , i 'd seen these pictures -- and i thought , " well , why that look on the face ?
but there 's some amazing opportunities in egypt as well .
it 's -- you know , today i 'd like to say it 's a zero billion dollar business , but , in fact , it 's negative .
so , another random thing i do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence , or seti .
it sounds really dumb , but that 's what it is .
the study of dinosaurs may , literally , one day save the planet .
i think paul simon is in the audience , and he has -- he may not realize it , but he wrote a song all about whale sex , " slip-slidin ' away . "
it is the place where we 're learning the most .
well first of all , it 's because we can read it , which is fantastic .
just like genome mixes the study of all the genes , proteomics is the study of all the proteins .
and i realized , wow , this would really make a big difference , if we could do it , and so i said , " well , let 's look at it . "
and so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences .
it 's you ; you 're broken .
so your house is dealing with leaks all the time , but it 's fixing them . it 's draining them out and so on .
but i think eventually , we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer .
and so as we surveyed the , if you will , representatives from various tribal councils that met , also known as super bowl parties , we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day .
but it 's one that i think we need to learn from .
i 've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class .
and the elevator door opened , and they all walked out .
so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual competence , then something very important happens .
the first one , if you look at the declaration of independence and actually read it , the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights .
tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are .
but we 're not done yet . because then how do we go from stage four , which is great , to stage five ?
because we 've got people in all five , around us .
but today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic .
take-out sandwich shops , film processing drop-offs , peep-shows and necktie stores .
the next story is called " the haverpiece collection " a nondescript warehouse , visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the prykushko expressway , serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit .
and so what i 'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection .
well that 's going to be a breeding ground for compassion .
jean vanier helped found the l 'arche communities , which you can now find all over the world , communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities -- mostly down syndrome .
this is going to change science , i believe , and it will change religion .
so was martin luther king , jr . so was dorothy day .
camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best .
now , most of us work in open plan offices , without walls , where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers .
steve wozniak invented the first apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in hewlett-packard where he was working at the time .
ralph waldo emerson called him " a man who does not offend by superiority . "
my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when i was growing up , partly because it was filled with his very gentle , very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books .
number one : stop the madness for constant group work .
thank you . thank you .
and even as a child , he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity .
and a couple of years ago at amd , we came up with this idea of saying , what if we create this initiative we call 50x15 , where we are going to aim , that by the year 2015 , half of the world will be connected to the internet so that people and ideas can get connected .
therefore , when we see that , we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment .
what a place , what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools . and to my surprise , i learned in south africa they have 18 dialects , i always thought they only had two -- english and afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects .
and we 're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this , and can 't wait to see what comes out of this exciting , exciting activity .
i would have never imagined that , not in my wildest dreams did i think -- i don 't even consider myself to be an author .
i wanted to tell michael before he spoke that i really appreciate what he does , because it makes my life work a whole lot easier .
but everybody 's got -- and i believe in a pluralistic society -- everybody 's betting on something .
when he said the word " species , " he was revealing his worldview .
and i gave it back because i didn 't want anybody thinking that i do what i do for money -- i don 't .
and that i know , personally , i know , is not true .
i want you to give me power .
and god says , " moses , what 's in your hand ? "
well , it was a shepherd 's staff . now , follow me on this .
you 're an nba player . it represents your income .
and i just watched their little bodies rise and lower , rise and lower .
so , in rough numbers , there are a million laptops .
laptops are a luxury ; it 's like giving them ipods . no .
my friend looks at me totally blankly .
one reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
but there 's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
the miracle of your mind isn 't that you can see the world as it is .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
the theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
so where 's the link between these two things ?
he was at hopkins when he did this , and he 's such a modest guy that the day he won , his mother called him and said , " i didn 't realize there was another ham smith at hopkins . do you know he just won the nobel ? " i mean , that was mom , but anyway , this guy is just a class act . you find him at the bench every single day , working on a pipette and building stuff . and one of the things this guy just built are these things .
her first job was at an inner-city motel in san francisco as a maid .
and i initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
bhutan , for those of you who don 't know it , is the newest democracy in the world , just two years ago .
the reality is , in western countries , quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out -- an object that we 're supposed to get , or maybe many objects .
why in the heck in america are we doing a census in 2010 ?
i learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same .
so , i 'm going to count to you , so we don 't all do it together .
now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . it 's evolutionarily a bad thing . if you 're not sure that 's a predator , it 's too late .
because they 're experts in play . so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . right ?
what was really exciting about this project was we , and beau , had no idea whether it would work .
it 's not written by me . it 's written by amy and the other students in the class . as a consequence , this science paper begins , " once upon a time ... " the results section , it says : " training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . " right ?
and i 'll just read one .
what 's the point ? the point is what science does for us .
it shortens the lives of the people who live there in the gulf .
we feel so good about ourselves .
and so we 're on one planet , and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems .
it turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well .
and yet , as a movement that has to broaden its constituency , that has to grow , that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone , one of the challenges to the success of this movement , of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift , is people look at our movement with some suspicion .
at the end of my first year in school , in the summer of that year , i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home .
i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally , and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do so , but it 's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time .
now i would argue , actually , if you look at the fact that on the highways today , you 're only averaging about 30 miles per hour -- on average , according to the dot -- the skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour , up to 25,000 feet .
finally , in the early part of -- or actually the middle of 2002 , we flew the 400 -- m400 , which was the four-passenger vehicle .
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
forty-seven percent -- yes , as soon as they could -- price could come down .
so definition number six is the north american definition of the word " suck . "
but inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire .
home electronics .
it creates a magnetic field here .
and i know some of you are apple aficionados .
a recent study found bpa in 93 percent of people six and older .
so i thought maybe i could train an army of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body .
and believe it or not , a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms .
i said , " you jerk . "
so we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty .
so we fought , we struggled , we triumphed .
i believed i could keep him from dying , and i 'd be embarrassed to say that if i hadn 't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way .
it 's not a bug .
he 's won all the fights , he 's eluded all the people that are out to get him , and yet this time , finally , he 's come to the city of alexandria and realized he 's lost .
so the virtual earth initiative , and other types of these initiatives , are all about extending our current search metaphor .
i bet many of you have seen the apple commercials , kind of poking at the pc for their brilliance and simplicity .
what does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives ?
over the last 30 years , in terms of the gdp growth rates , china has grown at twice the rate of india .
if you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe , then you will put less emphasis on strong government .
india is the smaller of the two countries , and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late 1990s .
in east asia , we have had successful economic growth stories such as korea , taiwan , hong kong and singapore .
and this is the earliest data that i can find .
these are the two pictures taken of garment factories in guangdong province and garment factories in india .
and my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges , because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms .
india has the right institutional conditions for economic growth , whereas china is still struggling with political reforms .
it was a space , as matt ridley talked about , where ideas could have sex .
so , the technology is there .
you know , you 're sitting there thinking a deep thought , and the apple falls from the tree , and you have the theory of gravity .
darwin is a great example of this .
and it 's monday morning , and the news has just broken about this satellite that 's now orbiting the planet .
and then they played around with it a little bit more , and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties .
when you build them right , they will be led to completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of .
buffett likes to point out that in 1992 , the combined wealth of the people on the forbes 400 list -- and this is the list of the 400 richest americans -- was 300 billion dollars .
in and of themselves , these aren 't too mysterious .
think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt .
let 's start with technology .
we created unions .
i really apologize to everybody for doing that , because obviously , we don 't .
so a group of us started doing survey work , and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle , in the newcastle area , and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating .
by the time you 've reached 80 , this is unlikely to happen to you .
ninety-eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice , and that this is how things should work .
so that one didn 't really run , but i was very struck by this .
my grandmother was on a train to auschwitz , the death camp .
so i started that , and worked in his lab for a year , and found the results that i guess you 'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really , really impaired the nervous system .
because what stem cells are -- they 're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue .
so these articles were saying , you know , " skeletal -- metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare . "
so this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more , an angiogenic routing factor , so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow -- this could be a potential future therapy for cancer .
these cells are so versatile , these cancer cells are so versatile -- we just have to manipulate them in the right way .
the family had a small shed on the side of the house , so i said , " could i sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings ? "
again , not at all shy or withdrawn , or anything like the other children that i 'd photographed .
if you know of photographers , the joke is it 's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented .
it was incredibly cold .
and i was really appalled , and i couldn 't figure out what to do .
who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this ? ' " and i said , you know , " look , " i said , " you 're absolutely right .
hyun-sook stayed at father keene 's , and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .
this is the uncle signing the adoption papers .
and i don 't speak korean , but i 'm hearing these voices , and i 'm not hearing anger , i 'm hearing terror .
and gene , who 's lying on the floor , says , " man , we 've got to soak towels . " i said , " what ? "
and we kept saying , " do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire , like eight hours ago ? "
so you know , if you were writing this , you 'd say , " no , we 've got to write the script differently . "
she bought a bright red karmann ghia with the money she made working at burger king .
rs : anyway , thank you , mike and richard , so much for letting us tell the story .
now , the good news .
we do that in our solar system .
and now for the first time , we can say that .
and let me immediately tell you here , when i say life , i don 't mean " dolce vita , " good life , human life .
am i that charming ?
let 's actually try that .
and the good news is we can actually , indeed do it .
they went upwards like this .
it is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it .
the ones with the highest income , the better off -- i wouldn 't say rich -- they have higher hiv .
but , there is one part of africa -- and the difficult thing is , at the same time , not to make a uniform statement about africa , not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this , on one hand .
and we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart , we will not only have the money , but we will also use the brain .
in fact , in 1500 , the average chinese was richer than the average north american .
he said it was " because they have laws and rules invented by reason . "
and he said it such a long time ago .
once you do that , your artillery becomes accurate .
the consumer society is what you need for the industrial revolution to have a point .
not only has japan been ahead for some time , south korea has gone into third place , and china is just about to overtake germany .
and i think these words really nail it : " it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .
and there is this impression that north america and europe are not really paying attention to these trends .
to put that number into perspective , here 's a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates .
you can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets , because each spinneret has many spigots on it .
so for example this would be one sentence , and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine , that repeats over and over and over again , and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule .
but how about variation among spider species , so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders ?
in addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks , personally , i find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself .
so , in new york city , on the first saturday of every summer , coney island , our local , charmingly run-down amusement park , hosts the mermaid parade . it 's an amateur parade ; people come from all over the city ; people get all dressed up .
first of all , when you form an institution , you take on a management problem , right ?
" call me when you get off work . " right ?
so , the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter .
we have over here psycho milt , a flickr user , who has contributed one , and only one , photo titled " iraq . "
you can hear this distribution under that complaint .
it 's a revolution in that it 's a change in equilibrium .
they even have lance armstrong-style bracelets , these red bracelets , which signify , in the small group , i am trying to maintain my eating disorder .
but the point is that it 's going to be a massive readjustment .
so , this is the challenge for this bread .
there 's no gluten in flour . there 's only the potential for gluten .
three transformations take place in the oven .
because what happens is , bread begins as wheat or any other grain .
i 'd call that radical .
it 's still dough . nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do , i think , but not too many .
but we 've got this bread , and what i did here is to try to , again , evoke even more flavor from this grain , was we 've added into it the spent grain from beer-making .
in fact , that was a piece by beethoven , and so i was not functioning as a composer .
so this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world of this instrument , which i think is quite interesting and it puts me in the role of the inventor , and the nice thing about — this instrument is called the mouseketeer ...
so one of the things is that , i mean , some people would say , like , " oh , you 're being a dilettante , " and maybe that 's true . i can understand how , i mean , because i don 't have a pedigree in visual art and i don 't have any training , but it 's just something that i wanted to do as an extension of my composition , as an extension of a kind of creative impulse .
but let 's move on to a piece where clearly i 'm behaving myself , and that is my " concerto for orchestra . "
and with that , i thank you very much .
i tasted the broccoli . mmmmm . "
on one side is a new caledonian crow .
well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
and that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
but unconsciously , they 're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
he told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
so we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
i 'm going to talk about a technology that we 're developing at oxford now , that we think is going to change the way that computer games and hollywood movies are being made .
if i push chris a bit , like this , for example , he 'll react to it .
and you repeat that process over and over again , until you have something that walks -- in this case , in a straight line , like this .
now , this might look kind of trivial , but it 's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
but what you 'll see is -- it 's going to receive a push now from the left .
we just took this character that i just talked about , put it on a slippery surface , and this is what you get out of it .
so if you look at the character carefully , you see there are lots of body movements going on , none of which you have to animate like in the old days .
we did that . it took about altogether just two hours , pretty much , to create the simulation .
just finally , this is only just the beginning .
thanks .
shake it , and you have a heterosexual couple .
i have another idea .
i punched every touch tone i was told , but i still spent 18 hours on hold .
this is what the computer interface used to look like , dos .
but why is the technical overload crisis , the complexity crisis , accelerating now ? in the hardware world , it 's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller , smaller , smaller .
this is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of microsoft word , the copy that you have , with all the toolbars open .
i 'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent , but it 's better .
on the opposite side of the monitor , a task bar appears , and somewhere in those links -- by the way , not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document .
they 're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh , but they can 't . they 're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .
so i was a little depressed -- then i heard al gore 's talk , and i realized i didn 't know the meaning of depressed .
like , i get hundreds of them a day . period .
hear , hear !
and the danger is that they can cause roughly what 's a pandemic .
and i would say that we can 't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that 's to give up the thing that makes civilization .
we 'll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shortly .
it 's a strange place inside a nanotube .
we 've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly .
the law requires accountability .
apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there , we 're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets .
so , wonderful things and grim things .
and the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information .
is it virus-sized ? is it smaller than that ?
the extremes on earth are interesting in their own right , but one of the reasons that we 're interested in them is because they represent , really , the average conditions that we may expect on other planets .
well , even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves , which are a by-product of volcanic activity , we find these walls totally covered , in many cases , by these beautiful , glistening silver walls , or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold .
i 'm not going to go through all of these projects now , but we 're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects , in collaboration with a number of different groups .
this will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century , and where i expect that we will have more and more mars missions to answer these questions .
1982 , peter gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009 , he did some new tests that were published .
it 's buried treasure .
he wanted to make that which was expensive free .
and normally in a book , you wouldn 't worry about the little bits , but these little bits might contain unique archimedes text .
how were we going to do that ?
well one of the unique texts in archimedes is called " the stomachion . "
it was such a great speech that the athenian law courts let him off .
and it 's an attractive and beautiful future , if only we can make it happen .
the original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century .
and i was outraged .
it has 360-degree views .
it was very green , it was very peppery .
the seat is preheated .
i switched lanes on the highway and the driver , this chaperone , said , " you know , you were just going 110 miles an hour . "
and at lunch on saturday , we opened the ' 47 .
now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media .
and this kind of a world , this vast flying beast you can ride around , shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking .
the game 's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes , getting better and better stuff in them .
so i 'm drawn on . it 's not too easy , not too difficult .
so , you give people lots and lots of different tasks .
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict enhanced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level .
and i just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world .
i 'm an archeological geneticist at the center for evolutionary medicine at the university of zurich , and i study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans .
we find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years .
especially if you 're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor 's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry , you 're pretty angry .
hunger definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does internationally , but it 's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .
most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers .
it 's the thirtieth anniversary of gmo crops and the big gulp , chicken mcnuggets , high fructose corn syrup , the farm crisis in america and the change in how we 've addressed agriculture internationally .
ellen gustafson : obesity + hunger = 1 global food issue
now i 'd argue that that is as absurd as stating that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act , and nine months of gestation , and , god forbid , 24 hours of child labor is merely execution .
now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor , because of course we all know that inside of the trojan horse were a bunch of people with spears .
well , something happened . in fact something happened to all institutions around the world .
now , that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time .
there you see it 's the side balconies for the proscenium .
you would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber : " aida , " their elephants , you can bring the elephants in .
this is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it .
and specifically , i 'm interested in collecting my own stories , stories from the internet , and then recently , stories from life , which is kind of a new area of work that i 've been doing recently .
this is , then , how they 're presented .
" i can feel my cancer grow . "
when i was sleeping , with a tripod and a timer .
introduction of red down here , when whales are being cut up .
this is the muktuk , or the blubber , all lined up for community distribution .
she thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in bhutan , and it 's a lot easier if you 're a boy .
she wanted a change in her life .
and she said , " well , you know , i think i 'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave . "
and up there , there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years .
and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques , and he 's the guy giving the lecture .
but i had three days of life support , and everybody was expecting , due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that i wasn 't going to make it , so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop , and — — when i finally pooped , then that somehow , surgically speaking , that 's like you crossed some good line , and , um — — on that day , the surgeon came in and whipped the sheet off of me .
that 's how we use language most .
the point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing .
and of course , theoretically , it does , and if you look at older texts , then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud .
it 's a way of using the language between actual people .
so , " from every college in the country goes up the cry , ' our freshmen can 't spell , can 't punctuate . ' " and so on . you can go even further back than this .
thank you very much .
and with that , i think i should give up the stage , so , thank you so much .
afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security .
well first see , if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like afghanistan where the entire revenue of the afghan state is one billion dollars a year , you drown everything .
paul fishstein who began working there in 1978 -- worked for save the children , ran the afghan research and evaluation unit .
we need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
borders between the bosniak territory and the bosnian-serb territory have calmed down .
it 's about context .
we should have limited ourselves very , very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in benghazi .
what is our approach ?
the second is , you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place .
and that problem is now , in a purely engineering way , solved .
now even that 's more complicated than you think .
there 's another very interesting connection here , and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system .
you dip in a corner . the fluid goes into the center .
interesting problem .
no big surprise , obama couldn 't do better than kerry there .
so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question .
so yes , racism is predictable .
you see people without neighbors who are african-american who were much more likely to say , " that would give me a problem . "
if we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn 't , we can start to design solutions to it .
since we 're in edinburgh , i 'm a big fan of conan doyle .
and finally , she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand , a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in burntisland . "
this is a very famous painting : " the doctor " by luke fildes .

they have often been rejected by their families , have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who 's about to disappoint them .
i took this to my colleagues at stanford in anthropology and told them the same story .
and i wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient .
some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term .
in science we have to keep the whole database , and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number that you would expect by chance .
or that the " world weekly news " makes stuff up ?
first of all , there was no theory of planetary rings .
and , of course , happy faces .
so we walked around the backside , just to see what was going on here , where -- it turns out wherever there 's a sprinkler head and a palm tree , you get the effect .
very -- one of the top popular singers in england today , katie melua .
and what 's happening is that there 's a globalization of illness occurring , that people are starting to eat like us , and live like us , and die like us . and in one generation , for example , asia 's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest . and in africa , cardiovascular disease equals the hiv and aids deaths in most countries .
four million of these babies die annually .

zappos is the one , the only , the best-there-ever-was to talk about their passion , to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow .
and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says , " what are those ? "
if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded , that 's where charisma comes from -- from the leading .
the sensor would have to be inexpensive , rapid , simple , sensitive , selective , and minimally invasive .
so that 's why i chose to use paper .
the result ? one small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run .
they have different interests . they have divergent values .
they were created by a kuwaiti psychologist called naif al mutawa .
that 's the million-dollar question , right ?
and we think it 's a given , and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that .
so the first group is : i am most drawn to my partner when she is away , when we are apart , when we reunite .
because in some way one could say sex isn 't something you do , eh ?
those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death .
they can go off in their imagination , off in their body , off in their playfulness , all the while knowing that there 's somebody when they come back .
they understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them .
the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
it 's smaller than this .
there 's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked .
and they no longer have to be exactly the same .
there 's one other kind of new venue , the private mp3 player .
but this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
and this man looked me up and down for about 10 seconds , and he said , " my , what an anticlimax ! "

they were able to mobilize young women .
instead , it 's about cooperation , and the right type of cooperation .
foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the mason-pfizer monkey virus .
these are necessary but insufficient questions .
these records were human resource forms .
the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need .
and the reality of the society that we 're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , screaming desperation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don 't need to impress people they don 't like .
play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
now i don 't mean to mock , but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn 't more balanced ; it 's more fit .
because if enough people do it , we can change society 's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins , to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like .
environmental justice , for those of you who may not be familiar with the term , goes something like this : no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other .
yeah , i 'm a poor black child from the ghetto .
the disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come .
we also built the city 's -- new york city 's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices .
but -- i know it 's the bottom line , or one 's perception of it , that motivates people in the end .
he looked at the demographics .
i don 't think he understood that i wasn 't asking for funding .
in this one , the creator told a narrative about how she had googled to find out when mother 's day was happening .
and i 'm really interested in seeing , how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies ?
here 's an example from hong kong , where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor , so the light sensor detects the hole in the board , so as they move the physical saw , the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree .
let me show you an example .
as victor worked on this project and created the scripts , he was also learning about the process of design , how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully-fledged , functioning project like you see here .
thanks very much .
and that tension , that discovery , that push for something new -- and at the same time , that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship -- that 's as strong in cars as it is in anything .
we 're not trying to find vanity and beauty .
we have to have a shared intimacy , a shared vision -- that means we have to work as one family ; we have to understand ourselves that way .
we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we 'd done it , that i only had a phone number that connected me to them .
well , what i didn 't know was , and what we found out was -- these guys , they can 't even like talk to each other under those conditions .
i screamed at them , i yelled at them , " what the hell are you doing ?
one of those was the idea of a crossover coupes -- you see it downstairs , the x coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that .
and this inadequacy of cancer medicine really hit home when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer .
and so we started to work on this problem .
and he obliged us .
nice to be able to demonstrate that for you .
this research is funded by the public .
if you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity , it would be moving away from you .
and boltzmann 's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy .
he gave the popular lectures that became " the character of physical law . "
for one thing , the universe will expand forever .
it 's very , very unlikely .
in boltzmann 's scenario , if you want to make an apple pie , you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie .
that universe will last 10 to the 100 years -- a lot longer than our little universe has lived .
maybe there is something that naturally , through the growth of the laws of physics , gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations .
i had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people .
i couldn 't read english that well .
whatever happens , don 't give up .
a message written on a sticky note to my mom on paper can come to an sms , or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar -- a to-do list that automatically syncs with you .
so now , what i can do -- i can augment the world around me with this digital information .
what we 're doing here is actually -- for example , in this case , the book cover is matched with so many thousands , or maybe millions of books online , and checking out which book it is .
when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my full-size computer .
pm : yeah . yes , yes , of course .
and i really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of rio .
these pictures i 'm showing here , they are some pictures from madureira .
so you get a bus . it 's a simple bus that everybody knows .
let me just show a map of rio again .
you cannot deal with a city if it 's not socially integrated .
you see just a little bit of moisture around the city .
ep : okay , osorio , thank you very much .
an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy .
beauty is an adaptive effect , which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment .
the trees , by the way , are often preferred if they fork near the ground , that is to say , if they 're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix .
so what were these ancient -- i mean , they 're ancient , they 're foreign , but they 're at the same time somehow familiar .
thank you .
well , it 's a rather complex system , but let me try to explain it , maybe simplify it .
so over here , you can see how the computer understands the environment , and because you cannot see the vibration , we actually put red led 's on the driver so that you can see what 's happening .
and he 's [ unclear ] following that van that 's out in front of him .
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .
" she is going to a lecture . "
you see that glass of water ?
i 've got a plastic fork , don 't you know ? "
in the last 20 years , the hearing voices movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
i wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology , because i think i know very little about that -- i 'm not a biologist -- so everything i know about it can be said in one minute .
that 's something we don 't yet know how to do .
but if they just simply could grow , like leaves , little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight , then they could keep warm on the surface .
so i have proposed to apply the same trick to looking for life in the universe .
so , i hope in the next 10 years , we 'll find these creatures , and then , of course , our whole view of life in the universe will change .
it was really a death trap . i mean , it was incredible , it worked incredibly well , but it was really dangerous .
and that allows me to check my timer discretely , here , without bending my elbow .
but the other thing that is humanistic about jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff , and all the nerdy stuff out of it , and try to make it as beautiful as we can .
thank you .
and in a way , it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea .
get some .
you can see my little video there conducting these people , alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home .
they 're saving us by redefining and re-imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities , polarities we 've taken for granted for a long time , like the ones between modernity and tradition , first world and third world , oppression and opportunity .
they wiped her bindi off her forehead .
had i heard right ?
to be a lesbian , a dyke , a homosexual in most parts of the world , including right here in our country , india , is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice .
one night , she had a dream .
you can see the policeman 's face .
allies like the imam , allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in croatia , allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away , allies like my father , who couldn 't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams .
overnight , my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak -- a single mother in sacramento , a girl being bullied in rural kansas , all asking me , a 22-year-old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order , to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox .
and as a chemist , one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is , could we make a really cool universal chemistry set ?
and if that doesn 't seem fanciful enough , where do you think we 're going to go ?
because the kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of islam , that of prophet muhammad .
it was there for thousands of years .
the name of the book is " islam without extremes : a muslim case for liberty . "
and they looked back at islamic tradition , they saw that there are problematic aspects , but they 're not the core of the religion , so maybe they can be re-understood , and the koran can be reread in the modern world .
and when the colonial period ended , what you had in place of that was , generally , secular dictators , which say they 're a country , but did not bring democracy to the country , and established their own dictatorship .
you must have all seen the arab spring , which began in tunis and in egypt .
you really would be kind of out of luck .
because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell , that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein , you get a cell to glow many different colors .
these are not normally the most cheerful of topics , nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about .
the highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001 , with about 80,000 soldiers , policemen and rebels killed every year .
but let 's look at the good news again .
the comprehensive peace agreement for sudan signed in 2005 turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged , and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full-scale return to war between north and south .
institutional design requires a keen focus on issues , innovative thinking and flexible and well-funded implementation .
the oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today .
life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate .
forests arose and nurtured things with wings .
new predators , hyenas , getting faster and faster still .
and you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next .
parents would shuffle kids away from us .
so in 2005 , the campaign got more momentum , was more successful in australia and then new zealand , and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point .
so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets .
and he goes , " last year , my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka , because we couldn 't afford proper treatment for her , " and he said , " this mustache is my tribute to my mom . "
and that 's how we 're redefining the research world .
this is the person who contains within him all the knowledge , all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life , and not just about his people , but about everything that his people 's survival depended on : the trees , the birds , the water , the soil , the forest .
it 's a future we don 't know the details of , but it 's a future that has signs , just like benki saw the signs around him .
i started life as a banker .
they take care of 20,000-odd people today in over 1,000 villages around karnataka .
he 's been a collector all of his life , starting when he was four or five in the early 1960 's .
they know people have come before them and will follow them .
but his brother , ganesha , simply walked around his parents once , twice , thrice , and said , " i won . "
this river lends itself to india 's name .
don 't live a life which is monotonous , mediocre , meaningless .
but you don 't cross it once .
so , no matter what he did , it was always zero .
there is one performer standing there , and everybody follows .
i even was a business consultant , doing strategies and tactics .
you see it is based on the hindu ritual of darshan .
depending on the context , depending on the outcome , choose your paradigm .
so the people looking for good jobs are going to fail .
i 'm not prepared to pursue my passion , so i know what i 'm going to do , because i have , i have a solution , i have a strategy .
passion is the thing that will help you create the highest expression of your talent .
but then , there are some of you , in spite of all these excuses , you will find , you will find your passion , and you 'll still fail .
you say , you say , " umm ... that 's risky , kid .
you 're afraid to try . you 're afraid you may fail .
she came to see me after discovering a breast lump .
radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram .
if we think about disruptive technology , we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive .
but michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he 'd seen , and this is it .
but the mbi image shows that tumor much more clearly , as well as a second tumor , which profoundly influence that patient 's surgical options .
it takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding .
some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later , and most women , thankfully , survive .
and there 's this loud , thrilling music in the background , this wild music .
but it brings me back .
okay , last question -- harder question -- when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case , should we use a kantian deontological moral framework , or should we use a millian consequentialist one ?
a brilliant guy -- he 's been dead 2,500 years .
and therefore , it 's not a matter of opinion .
that 's a utilitarian moral framework .
he has autonomy .
we 're the ones who have to do it .
not right now . wait till i finish talking .
we care what happens in " apocalypse now . "
marketing people have never been able to do that .
but it is just physiology . it 's just in your brain .
and the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object , for sure , but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object .
so i turned traditional pills into this .
so by this way , the kid , to take care of himself , is to take care of this living object .
and it was singing all day long . and when it stops it means that it just died .
this one is kind of the same approach because i include , in a product like andrea , some plants .
but it was important to create a perfect place , so i tried to , in order to work and create .
so , if you believe the media accounts , being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life , in the words of virginia postrel .
you can 't get rich selling marijuana .
and then , when you come down , all you want to do is get high again .
this is about 1990 -- peak of the crack epidemic .
it was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever -- -- but i was glad to be the beneficiary of it .
and they 're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit , depending on how good they are at running the business .
and one of the sad parts of this is that indeed , among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities -- this is what they were striving for .
so why in the world , you might ask , would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for $ 3.50 an hour , with a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years ?
and really , they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be .
here 's another one .
i started with paragliding .
so my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before .
i think we all might have some questions .
ue : the purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles .
this whole idea of sharing , the idea of constituting reality by overlapping what i say and what you say -- think of a movie .
how do we know that being in a space makes a difference ?
these kinds of experiments , they filter into architectural models .
so this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space .
and experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .
but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana , two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems .
now , what you 're seeing is the intensified camera 's view under red light , and that 's all dr. kubodera could see when the giant comes in here .
ghosts , right ?
gerard manley hopkins , a saintly man .
i have so much admiration for him .
but we 've been much more reticent , much slower at recognizing this continuity in cognition , in emotion , in consciousness in other animals .
so the dolphins could hit a key , a symbol , they heard a computer-generated whistle , and they got an object or activity .
play a real quiet grooming song .
now we started talking with ted about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to ted , and we realized that wouldn 't work .
ng : those are for you .
this is what the internet looks like to a computer that 's trying to figure out where the traffic is supposed to go .
you 're launching this idea here at ted — pg : today .
dr : thank you . vc : thank you .
so i 'm like , whoa .
they have graphic designers . what ?
you have lebanon that just -- a few days ago .
and i was in munich a few weeks ago .
and really , we can be our own ambassadors .
and what we 'd like to say with " yes is more " is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined , as who or what we are against .
the first story starts last year when we went to shanghai to do the competition for the danish national pavilion for the world expo in 2010 .
you know , you 're not supposed to take long , warm showers .
so we thought , why don 't we reintroduce the bicycle in china ?
the second thing , we had compared the swan to the dragon , and then the chinese state said , " suggest change to panda . "
this is our first architectural model .
at the same time , we actually had a visitor -- a minister from azerbaijan came to our office .
so in a way you can see how the mountain in copenhagen sort of evolved into the seven peaks of azerbaijan .
if we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
of course , you have to ask yourself , why on earth was such a list never done before ?
what would be the price ?
as you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
but it 's to say , when we don 't , it 's just simply not our first priority .
basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of hiv / aids .
much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
you know , we spend 100 billion dollars -- why don 't we spend that on doing good in the world ?
at the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there 's some things we do , there are other things we don 't do .
over the last 10 years , i 've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries , many of them in the emerging markets , in latin america , asia , and my own continent of africa .
thirdly , people in the emerging markets look at china 's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout .
but it also says that as china moves toward being the largest economy in the world , something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016 , that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the west and the rest is likely to widen .
because ultimately , the question before us , and the question before seven billion people on the planet is , how can we create prosperity ?
it was a little bit too funky , and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way -- fashion .
and the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do , but the elephant really has his own ideas .
doing things like i 'm doing right now -- traveling to cannes .
i 'm essentially using a kombucha recipe , which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria , yeasts and other micro-organisms , which spin cellulose in a fermentation process .
and when it 's ready to harvest , you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold , soapy water .
make it hydrophobic .
suzanne lee : grow your own clothes
so i spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south china factory city called dongguan .
how much money can i save ?
their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated , surprising and funny than he could have imagined .
they usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade .
we 've obtained a propaganda video made by the taliban .
step three : the taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in .
but only if i get permission from my dad .
and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life .
and then this happened .
a building like 60 hudson , and a dozen or so others , has 10 times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings .
they looked for the unwired places , and that 's meant north and south , primarily these cables to africa .
thank you .
and this material that 's deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form .
so really the resolution is quite incredible .
there 's a lower chance of rejection .
there 's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in china .
what 's more likely , and we 're seeing it today , is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center .
we like different things .
we didn 't know any better . we didn 't pause to ask .
the supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling .
last year , they took control over a portion of southern yemen , and ran it , taliban-style .
any claim that al qaeda had to being protectors of islam against the western crusaders was drowned in the blood of iraqi muslims .
bin laden is dead . bin ladenism has been defeated .
and i would see kids on the street corners , and they 'd say " obama , he 's our brother ! "
and i reflected , as i was watching her sell the dresses , and also the jewelry that she makes , that now jane makes more than four dollars a day .
but maybe me , i give out something better because i give them hope . "
have you ever wanted to write a novel ?
my family had moved from fort lee , new jersey to california , and we moved from the snow to lots of heat , and gas lines .
i began operating my business with 1-2-3 , began writing add-ins for 1-2-3 , wrote a natural language interface to 1-2-3 .
first of all , there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques , not to mention really cheap miniature motors -- brushless motors , servo motors , stepper motors , that are used in printers and scanners and things like that .
it collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day .
and the hot air engine also was not invented by robert stirling , but robert stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it .
take it off the flame and pour water on it , or let it cool down , the piston moves down .
let me show you what it looks like in real life .
we have an inverter in there , so you get 117 volts a.c.
and all this does is affect the payback period , it doesn 't mean that you couldn 't use solar energy ; you could use solar energy anywhere on earth .
but , everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it 's so cheap .
but despite its very small weight , enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet .
we have to get special flight clearance .
i was lucky enough to be completely ignored , which is a fabulous thing , actually , i want to tell you .
you really have to be journalists , you have to be inventors , you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything .
i don 't know what a plot means .
i said , people should know about this book .
and i said , " yes , but how much space do i have ? "
leaving the shack , the wild blueberry woods , the geese , the river sluch , they went to palestine and then america . "
i 'm going to quickly go through this .
and then i photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street .
and what i mostly say is that , at that time , it was a pretty interesting idea to me .
we heard a lot about technology this week , and it 's important for us to remember to invest a lot of our energy in improving the technology of the heart .
and i think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us , but that , if we pay attention , we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take .
let 's see what evolution can do for us .
so that was what happened when we had a couple of -- that 's what happened when you had a couple of -- ok , ok , ok -- -- they don 't like each other . so there 's a different robot .
katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand , to be capable of handling things .
and of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans .
and 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage .
you 're the mayor of your local town .
or can we get away with some different kinds of masks ?
and so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations all over america .
how many masks do you need ?
laurie garret : what factors determine the duration of a pandemic , we don 't really know .
it takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory , in highly skilled hands .
and so far in the h5n1 cases in people , similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all .
these are from remote control airplanes .
but here i am .
and i 'm not cheating . it 's in the back . it 's perfect .
they are impossible to juggle . "
but nobody wanted to hire me .
so after the walk people ask me , " how can you top that ? "
i mean , a bird needs space to fly .
and at the end i bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird .
thank you . thank you .
but rather , it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog .
up in the canopy , if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems , you would also see scenes like this .
this is a fantastic installation by bruce chao who is chair of the sculpture and glass blowing department at rhode island school of design .
well , my thought was that i could learn how to grow mosses , and that way we wouldn 't have to take them out of the wild .
so , although it 's a little bit of a fantasy , i think it 's also a reality .
and so she set about to make it so .
obviously the church weren 't very happy about this , and they tried to suppress it , but what they hadn 't counted on was technology , and then they had the printing press , which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply , far and fast , and people would come together in coffee houses , discuss the ideas , plot revolution .
it 's the icelandic modern media initiative , and they 've just got funding to make it an international modern media project , and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression , protection of whistleblowers , protection from libel , source protection , and trying to make iceland a publishing haven .
the other thing is that power is incredibly seductive , and you must have two real qualities , i think , when you come to the table , when you 're dealing with power , talking about power , because of its seductive capacity .
you have the national security agency building the world 's giantest spy center . it 's just this colossal -- it 's five times bigger than the u.s. capitol , in which they 're going to intercept and analyze communications , traffic and personal data to try and figure out who 's the troublemaker in society .
i learned two really important things that day .
the nitrogen just sort of floats around in our blood and tissues , and that 's all fine , that 's how we 're designed .
now helium 's a gas , there 're a lot of reasons why helium 's good , it 's a tiny molecule , it 's inert , it doesn 't give you narcosis .
well , in order to really understand how they do that you have to take off the hood , and look underneath and see what 's going on .
and usually we 'll have a slightly larger cylinder mounted exterior on the rebreather , like this .
that 's kind of what it feels like . it 's pretty amazing .
diver 2 : uh , silvertip sharks .
even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing , just look at the monetary value of this thing .
so , what i 'm going to show you right now , very quickly , is just a sampling of a few of the new species we 've discovered .
so , i guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest , he absolutely did .
but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms , without even doing an ecg or a chest x-ray to look at the heart .
these are the faces of the children that i have tested with stories just like justin .
we only meet them once .
so , those are the two clips i 'm going to show .
nk : well actually i 'm here because i 'm the architect 's son , he was my father .
in social aspect of his life he was just like a child , he was not at all matured .
is it really just us ?
remember , one billion ?
so , ultimately what 's going to determine the success or failure of seti is the longevity of technologies , and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos -- distance over space and distance over time .
we are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution , and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story , and perhaps seti will help as well .
and in 2009 , change has come to washington , with a promise to put science in its rightful position .
if seti does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet , then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history .
wais divide itself though , is a circle of tents in the snow .
most importantly , these cylinders and this snow trap air .
early explorers sailed off the edge of the map , and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended .
but in the nine years before drake struck oil , in 1859 , at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared , thanks to fatal competitors , chiefly oil and gas made from coal , to which the whalers had not been paying attention .
and our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in far-off-istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect american citizens .
but it 's even a better deal for heavy trucks , where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon , with better aerodynamics and tires and engines , and so on , and taking out weight so you can put it into payload .
the mclaren just popped off and scratched the side panel .
and then another six can be made robustly , competitively , from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel , without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production .
so this is a huge social win , too .
well , that was with very old technologies and delivery methods .
and interval research is kind of the living example of how that can be true .
we 've made half-a-billion impressions with marketing and pr for this brand , purple moon .
girl 9 : my friend justine kinda took my friend kelly , and now they 're being mean to me .
gee , i doubt i 'll make max 's best people list .
this is hermann goering .
he had a lesser charge of forgery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people .
i want to convince you that humans are , to some extent , natural born essentialists .

the operator says , " just take it easy .
in this first-of-its-kind demo , heather knight introduces data , a robotic stand-up comedian that does much more than rattle off one-liners -- it gathers audience feedback and tunes its act as the crowd responds . is this thing on ?
the economies of the future depend on that .
what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that i need right now ?
here is my father at age 19 .
indeed , it 's rather small .
the whole family came to settle in france in the ' 30s .
now , of course , the man was very impressed with this young man of 17 who could immediately give him the formula , so he recruited him .
how can one explain what one does at night in the lab , every single night ?
my father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the dominican republic , haiti , and then it was the turn of brazil , argentina , venezuela , el salvador , nicaragua , colombia , peru , uruguay , chile and mexico .

the majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority , the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid-18th century .
the system suddenly , very surprisingly , loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover .
in fact , most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three musketeers , " one for all . all for one . "
do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level ?

you know , when i was a teenager , i was a creator .
well , when i started working with my own work , i decided that i shouldn 't do images .
because clouds can mean anything you want .
i started taking that into the realm of landscape , which is something that 's almost a picture of nothing .
i used the dust at the whitney museum to render some pieces of their collection .
i wasn 't interested in the very large things , or in the small things .
what i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans .
and if you look outside africa , you actually find less genetic variation .
this may be surprising .
and one question that you may then want to ask is , what happened when we met ?
we call this group of humans , that we then described for the first time from this tiny , tiny little piece of bone , the denisovans , after this place where they were first described .
difficult question , simple answer : nothing .
so for instance , we are asking ourselves , how can we create more light ?
so we see a bottom-up approach here , because all the information , as i said , are inside the dna .
it 's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves , to understand the world around them , is shaped by that stance .
and they learn soon enough , even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want .
but in fact the brain also becomes who we are , and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction , this is what 's happening with her mind and this is what 's happening with her brain .
there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism . in fact , we believe that there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism , and genetic anomalies , much more than just genes .
they are focusing on the revolving door , opening and shutting .
there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities , preventing , in fact , those experiences that i really started in my journey in this field .
he checks you out , he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed , your shoulders are crushed down , and , of course , he 's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well .
so nice air comes flowing in .
and that 's not going to hurt .
and i 'm not sure that was real interaction .
we had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations .
and it forced me to become a lot more transparent , a lot more willing to listen , a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower .
every ranger promises every other ranger , " no matter what happens , no matter what it costs me , if you need me , i 'm coming . "
and if i were to write a volume , it would be called , " artists who have led my exhibitions " because my work , in understanding art and in understanding culture , has come by following artists , by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are .
it 's always what it was and what it can be .
this new set of questions is : what does it mean , right now , to be african-american in america ?
thank you .
so when they spoke into it , the computer typed out gibberish , so they said , " well , it doesn 't understand anything of what we are saying . "

and so , using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on , that actually got below market returns and was willing to go the long haul and be combined with management assistance , strategic assistance -- they 've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers .
well , in looking around for entrepreneurs , there was none better that we could find on earth than anuj shah , in a to z manufacturing company .
but because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital , we 've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector to distribute , and a dollar to buy the net .
i 'm going to be talking a little bit about music , machines and life .
so as the song picks up emotion , so should the machine get grander in its process .
and another engineer thought , " well , that would be a really good thing to use " and ended up using it as a really nice trigger .
but you don 't want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn 't work , right .
that one 's pretty good . it 's getting better .
for example , the " lady with the unicorn , " another painting by rafael , well , you see the unicorn .
we definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values , these cultural values that we badly need , especially today .
they 're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy .
these systems are really hard to build , but we 're just starting to be able to get there , and so , watch out .
you follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle -- that 's your 50-year time bubble . humans , livestock and pets are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent . we have won . the next generation doesn 't even have to worry about this game -- it is over .
trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward . it was a tough job , and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature .
there he 's the project manager . anything they do is certainly a team effort . he ran this program . here 's ...
but now , as they say in infomercials , we have something much better for you , which we 're working on : planes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size .
sort of a timeline , very non-linear scale , nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs , and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... birds were flying overhead , after pterosaurs .
thank you .
" it 'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop , wouldn 't it ? "
over thousands of years ago , he proved that for us .
he proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill , ink , paper and his mind .
it took him , by his estimate , " three years of sundays . "
they found another megaprime . "
my laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large numbers .
no , it wasn 't . the highlight of 2012 , so clearly , was the discovery of the higgs boson .
the tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes .
and yet , she was feeding three little baby tasmanian devils in her pouch .
but that is where the tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation .
when the devil bites another devil , it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil , so the tumor continues to grow .
well this is a question which fascinated chester southam , a cancer doctor in the 1950s .
take marriage for example .
okay , that 's about 10 people out of 1,500 .
the psychologists margaret marshall and john brown studied students with high and low expectations .
it 's not because they really , really like being in the office and they can 't stand strolling in the park or having a lazy brunch .
but this is not what we find .
and using a method called functional mri , we were able to identify regions in the brain that were responding to positive information .
and at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves , would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits ?
but if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best , you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground .
now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically , the barriers to entry go down .
you can do it with threats of coercion , " sticks , " you can do it with payments , " carrots , " or you can do it by getting others to want what you want .
the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality .
but you might ask , well so what in any case ?
top board : military power among states .
how do we define our national interests so that it 's not just zero sum , but positive sum .
so , short-term peacekeepers .
you can only get positive , that mental shift , if the reality is that prosperity is being built .
and there are two key things it 's got to do .
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to implement change is very limited .
there 's one sector which isn 't exposed to international trade , and which can generate a lot of jobs , and which is , in any case , a sensible sector to expand , post-conflict , and that is the construction sector .
and so what i 'd suggest is what i call independent service authorities .
paddy ashdown , who was the grand high nabob of bosnia to the united nations , in his book about his experience , he said , " i realize what i needed was accountants without borders , to follow that money . "

we 're operating outside the bounds of co2 concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years .
s : i don 't want to let my parents down .

and these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification , introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent , and also taking the hypothetical seriously , that is , wondering about what might have been rather than what is .

a third interview was conducted with someone about the north pole .
and you were supposed to think , well , the state legislature was rural-controlled , and they hated the big city , so rather than putting the capital in a big city , they put it in a county seat .

this is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old cds .
the captain was a captain of a sea-going ship .
thank you so much .
and let 's start with radical increases in resource efficiency .
the way we tend to use resources is we extract them , we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them .
and we 'd also have a coffee shop , and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms .
so amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource-constrained environment -- and in that sense , very relevant to the kind of challenges we 're going to be facing over the next few years , next few decades .
so this is how this scheme would look .
they 're not just possible ; they 're critical .
and if i want to start having children by the time i 'm 35 , that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago .
so in my case , i thought , well , will data and an algorithm lead me to my prince charming ?

so , it 's been a big , very complex project , which i was not sure was going to work at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things .
you know , we have a fairly interesting situation right now .
this is probably a fairly small piece of mathematica code that 's able to be run here .
some of these are hopeless universes , completely sterile , with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space , no notion of time , no matter , other problems like that .
stephen wolfram : well , the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true , things like the standard model of physics : what i 'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it 's simply wrong .
but there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease , because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don 't have diagnostic services , you end up creating a problem of drug resistance .

you are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better .
commodity prices are like this .

no one is at the beach . so there is a bright side to everything .
agritourism , going to vineyards and going to farms .

well , there is .
and when they jump up to the next place they can be , and fall back down again , they emit light at particular colors .
it 's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe .
it can also , i think , finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet .
that 's here . that 's home . that 's us .
a recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online .

now , you may remember me asking the question as well , a very interesting observation , that actually those strange little signs that actually flash " 35 " at you , occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown , according to whether you 're within or outside the speed limit -- those are actually more effective at preventing road accidents than speed cameras , which come with the actual threat of real punishment .
you have a series of buttons . you actually choose your lift music .
a yellow sign ? that 's exactly what they 'll be expecting .
but what 's interesting about that suggestion was that , to implement that suggestion wouldn 't cost 10 million pounds ; it wouldn 't involve large amounts of expenditure ; it would actually cost about 50 quid .
that 's called trivia .
the power and coherency that comes from one person hearing , perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience .
now , this requires another piece of hardware , which is this infrared pen .
so -- and that 's from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product .
this frustrated and confused me ; i felt like i had been just given a homework assignment that i had to do , and i was excited to do , but no matter what i would do , i would fail .
the truth be told , i was giving out of that place , not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity .
for the first time , actually , in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals , i wanted to meet these entrepreneurs , and see for myself what their lives were actually about .

i hope that kiva can blur those lines .
that 's a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
it 's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have , the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them , to gather them to make this happen .
what do you think of people in poverty ? maybe what jessica jackley once did : " they " need " our " help , in the form of a few coins in a jar . the co-founder of kiva.org talks about how her attitude changed -- and how her work with microloans has brought new power to people who live on a few dollars a day .

in fact , we don 't know about any life beyond earth , but i 'm going to suggest to you that that 's going to change rather soon , and part of the reason , in fact , the majority of the reason why i think that 's going to change is that the equipment 's getting better .
but now we do . recent results suggest that virtually every star has planets , and more than one .
and i think there 's a lesson in that , and that lesson is that if we pick up a signal , the media , the media will be on it faster than a weasel on ball bearings . it 's going to be fast .

now , that 's not true anymore .
but if you give talks to kids , you know , one in 50 of them , some light bulb goes off , and they think , " gee , i 'd never thought of that , " and then they go , you know , read a book or a magazine or whatever .

the feeling i had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement , of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility , of making sure everything is safe .
so , this girl died when she was about three , 3.3 million years ago .
it was not known in the fossil record , and we have it in this skeleton .
one is to continue to see a poor , ill , crying africa , carrying guns , that depends on other people forever , or to promote an africa which is confident , peaceful , independent , but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time .

i do not want to have my opinions challenged .
economics writer tim harford studies complex systems -- and finds a surprising link among the successful ones : they were built through trial and error . in this sparkling talk from tedglobal 2011 , he asks us to embrace our randomness and start making better mistakes .
even though it has delivered many benefits , it is based on a crazy idea -- the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet .
this is about food and water , soil and climate , the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives .
so when does this transition begin ?
imagine what you 'll tell your children when they ask you , " so , in 2012 , mom and dad , what was it like when you 'd had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row , when every scientific body in the world was saying you 've got a major problem , when the oceans were acidifying , when oil and food prices were spiking , when they were rioting in the streets of london and occupying wall street ?

so you can control for the basic things , like how hard the crash was , what seat the child was sitting in , etc . , the age of the child .
so we actually tried to commission some crash tests .
the federal standards are that you have to score below a 1,000 to be an approved car seat on this crash , in some metric of units which are not important .

so every idea is basically being supported -- or every item , or every noun -- is being supported by the entire web .
everything we 've described , every artifact or place , will be a specific representation , will have a specific character that can be linked to directly .
just like it wasn 't tv and only better .
and the one is us . we are in the one .
there was a burning question though that would not leave me .

there 's some air conditioning left in the base , but the skin now moves on hydraulics .
it demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it 's a system that 's developed not sculpturally .
and then , again , in a more , kind of traditional setting , this is a graduate student housing in toronto , and it 's very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city .
architect thom mayne has never been one to take the easy option , and this whistle-stop tour of the buildings he 's created makes you glad for it . these are big ideas cast in material form .
no , no , no , no . better -- to live of cooked food .
it keeps also your brain working .
think about bittersweet chocolate ; or think about the acidity of yogurt -- wonderful -- mixed with strawberry fruits .
this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest , which is actually the lumen .

thank you very much .
so , for all these reasons , i think we need better materials , and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials .
and because they 're made of natural materials , they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard .
and i want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen , because , over the five-day period , what they do is extend out and through this material , using the energy that 's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix .
and i think that can be some really good news .
the atoms lose their individual identity , and the rules from the quantum world take over , and that 's what gives superfluids such spooky properties .
the most surprising thing that i 've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research .
however , once we eliminate public funding for the arts , there will be some drawbacks .
to which the answer is , " the extroverted statistician 's the one who looks at the other person 's shoes . "
she paused and said , " he models things . "
so , on this side , you get out your coins , and you toss and toss and toss .
you can 't do that with head-tail-tail .
it 's another way of getting the intuition .
that 's one big project .
so let me try and illustrate that .
for various reasons , she was later charged with murder .
it 's worse than silly -- it 's really bad science .
what matters is how likely or unlikely , relative to each other , the two explanations are .
and everyone said , " well , that 's fine . he 's an expert . "
well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring .
so far we 've applied for 414 patent claims .

the chinese government blocked every single international web 2.0 service , and we chinese copycat every one .
2011 , in july , two [ unclear ] trains crashed , in wenzhou , a southern city .
and also , the clone , sina company is the guy who cloned twitter .
it 's like a big ted , right ?
you know , the server is in the [ central ] cats ' hands , so even that -- when the netizens criticize the local government , the local government has not any access to the data in beijing .
so that 's the update about this game , cat-and-mouse .
and when it comes to sensory restoration , we 're still very far away from being able to provide beauty .
mother : that 's an owl .
john niparko : so you 've written two books ?
now there are a lot of reasons for that .
you distort it a little bit , especially in terms of pitch , and you 've changed it .
i had patients tell me that those sound the same .
and this is of a student of mine named joseph who i had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab .
when it comes to restoration of hearing , we have certainly come a long way , a remarkably long way .

it 's easier to handle . it 's something that we understand really well .
paul rothemund writes code that causes dna to arrange itself into a star , a smiley face and more . sure , it 's a stunt , but it 's also a demonstration of self-assembly at the smallest of scales -- with vast implications for the future of making things .
you have to plan ahead to get to the top .
and of course there is rule number nine .
that 's been a strong interest of mine , and a theme that i 've developed for some 30 years .
the actual paradigm-shift rate , the rate of adopting new ideas , is doubling every decade , according to our models .
information technologies double their capacity , price performance , bandwidth , every year .
i mean , you 'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment , but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior -- countries accusing each other of dumping products , ipos , bankruptcies , marketing programs .
we 're understanding the software programs that make our body run .
these are some designs from eric drexler 's book -- which we 're now showing are feasible with super-computing simulations , where actually there are scientists building molecule-scale robots .
doug hofstadter wonders , well , maybe our intelligence just isn 't great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smarter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we 'd never catch up to it .
computers will combine the subtle pan-recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior , in terms of doing analytic thinking , remembering billions of facts accurately .
ray kurzweil : the accelerating power of technology
it 's uncomfortable to not believe things .
you 're more cautious . you 're more vigilant .
so when i go back without the prime , your brain already has the model so you can see it again .
so if you present subjects the images such that it 's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left , then they 're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere .
too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere .
that 's a dolphin tail there , guys .
and you are correct .
but this is a pattern detection problem , isn 't it ?
or you can do it through loss of consciousness , by accelerating in a centrifuge .
girl : yes .
and , once again , i got an extraordinary education , and it was the first time , really , that i 'd met a lot of these people in the different countries , and these human rights stories became very physical , and , again , i couldn 't really walk away quite so comfortably .
and the one who was raping evelyn came and defiled me also .
shoot a video ; expose injustice ; reveal the truth ; show us what 's wrong with the world ; and maybe we can help make it right .

and by and large , you 'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path .
shame .
so let 's turn that off . we 're indoors .
all right , from skate physics to theoretical physics .
so watch closely and see what your eyes can hear .
there 's very little evidence to suggest it , but what he did say is actually far nicer , and again , i 've printed this . i 'm going to read it out .
and that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .

good morning . my name is david rose .
and what 's the second most important thing after integrity ?
so you 've got to know your market .
but on top of that , i also need realism .
that 's it -- that should get you right there .
and that 's two parts .
here 's gates doing a thing for windows .
you look at the image and you see that , and you drop the whole thing .
and i want to know the market -- the size of the market .
and then all this ties into the financial overview .
what 's the capital structure up until this point ?

you know , i 'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
and these are facts , guys .
to be really , really serious .
we went to this prestigious little school and they say they 're going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
just play , that 's a stupid thing . "
but who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
it is a genetic birthright that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
it increases our openness to change .
there 's nothing weird about bulgarians that we can 't play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
i don 't care if it 's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
unacceptable . nepriemliv .
i want to show you my work so you know what i am doing and why i am here .
the playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer .
and i visited it with several ladies , and asked all sorts of questions of the director .
moderator : yes , i am sure .
i just looked at it , and i didn 't know what to do .
i want pieces . bits and pieces . "
i came to live it , and i am living it .
and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting .
the baby was coming , and i was ready for this mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet .
av : yes , and i often joke with rufus when he comes home that i 'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies .
and it 's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world .
there 's not really a lot of community support around it .
average happiness is , of course , inadequate , because it doesn 't speak to the moment-by-moment experience , and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience .
we raised the money , and we 're thrilled that we did , because in this phase of one 's life , the incredibly scarce resource is time .
let 's separate the performance , as a thing , out from the recording , which was how it was made .
and gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about , one in mono , and one in stereo .
but if you don 't have that , maybe you can listen on your headphones .
right , do you know where i 'm going ?
it 's a way better experience than whatever you 're used to listening to , in whatever form .
the effect , the payback , perhaps , for years of vampire predators like bernie madoff , whom we saw earlier .
unprecedented wealth and prosperity , but that growth hasn 't always delivered what we needed .
ronald reagan , again , said the two funniest sentences in the english language are , " i 'm from the government . and i 'm here to help . "
in science , we do experiments systematically .
across northern europe , many governments now have innovation laboratories within them .
i 'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost , though that might be quite tempting .
so all the way over on the left of this graph , what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year , and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year .
why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modify what i 'm saying to say , " it will rain , " or " it 's going to rain . "
well , what i did with that was to access the linguistics literature .
the survey takes over a day .
it 's current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
and one fine day , she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .
so everybody wants to have an english education , naturally .
if you think about the islamic golden age , there was lots of translation then .
and to do that , they need a western education .
a simple idea , but it could have such far-reaching consequences .
we didn 't -- a lot of flying , a lot of experiments , a lot of things that didn 't work , and ones that did work , and the plane kept getting a little better , a little better .
the green line goes down . that 's the wild nature portion .
as time went on , we stopped our environmental programs .
that plane is widely used by the military , now , in all their operations .
and that 's it , so you can just control it , wherever you want , and it 's just hours of fun . and these are no longer in production , so you have real collector 's items .
he is a very good colleague of einstein 's , we must say .
and where it 's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff , its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in . there was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds .
he was just immediately caught with the situation .
the future buddha has come ahead of all predictions . here he is . "
and also , actually , i 've been your mother .
and you think of him as nursing you .
but , actually , that 's practical .
but , of course , that is impractical . he should have founded the aspca in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots .
you can develop this . you can diminish the non-compassion , the cruelty , the callousness , the neglect of others , and take universal responsibility for them .
scissors are your clothes , glasses enable you to see things and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs or run down by automobiles , and books are , after all , your education .
and , interestingly , complexity is very highly evolved .
we 've heard from bill gates recently .
so it is very , very simple once you learn how to read it .
but the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers of simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple , in the sense that it is completely reliable .
so , how does one do that ?
and that certainly is going in the right direction .
another answer might be , well , it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage , who , working away on different kinds of bikes , comes up with a bike out of thin air .
well this view , i think , is increasingly wrong .
big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success .
so here in astronomy , you have this vast explosion of new productive resources .
usually they were reading the share prices , and the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor , or something like that , and you know , " for heaven 's sake , what are they doing !
it won 't be so clear-cut ; it won 't be microsoft versus linux -- there 'll be all sorts of things in between .

it 's been an interesting two weeks . "
" they used some of the morbidly artist footage , a close-up of chad 's shoes in the middle of the highway .
and so some really nice things came together .
and i said , " oh yeah , i 'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep . "
and so what i decided to do .
and so some of the brains that i 've studied are people you know about .
and it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development , which is kind of interesting because serotonin is supposed to make you calm and relaxed .
she goes , " no it gets worse , read this book . "
jim fallon : exploring the mind of a killer
so , you might be asking , " why ?
and when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
so , you want to know why the sky is blue , why atomic nuclei stick together -- in principle , you 've got a big enough computer -- why dna is the shape it is .
higgs particles , if you will .
the strong force , the strong nuclear force , which sticks nuclei together , gets weaker . and what you see is the standard model -- you can calculate how these change -- is the forces , the three forces , other than gravity , almost seem to come together at one point .
it was big enough to be transparent to light , and that 's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that george smoot described as looking at the face of god .
but i knew that i 'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true .
a recent study at uppsala university in sweden found that it 's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles .
ron gutman : the hidden power of smiling
and when colors came out everywhere , a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people .
we removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks .
they take it for granted that , come what may , people have to follow them , while politics , more and more , fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people .
its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age .
we started talking with a local telecom provider called voilà , which is a subsidiary of trilogy international .
one illustration of the transformational power of technology is in kibera .
my colleague , jason peat , who runs this program , tells me it 's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things .
the disastrous earthquake in haiti taught humanitarian groups an unexpected lesson : the power of mobile devices to coordinate , inform , and guide relief efforts . at tedxrc2 , paul conneally shows extraordinary examples of social media and other new technologies becoming central to humanitarian aid . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
it needs months and years .
news from india is a stream on my smartphone app whether i 'm in new york or new delhi .
there are those who went back to their lives , and those who are still displaced after so many months .
the present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future .
so it wasn 't just me , there was a whole generation of us .
and she shook her head and said , " oh , these americans . we gave them a language , why don 't they use it ? "
the old women in my father 's village , after this war had happened , memorized the names of every dead person , and they would sing these dirges , made up of these names .
anyway , a goat 's eyes are like a child 's eyes .
so , here was this 14-year-old kid on death row .
this is how they came to reclaim their humanity .
so you 're now about 14 billion years into this .
under that theory , we are the be-all and end-all of all creation .
this explains most contemporary political debates .
well it turns out that every male olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants .
and then what they did in october is they took skin cells , turned them into stem cells and began to turn them into liver cells .
here 's what it looks like in 2002 , 2006 , 2008 .
but when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition , either you 're not measuring it right or there 's something going on very quickly , and it may be evolution in real time .
it consumes about 15 watts of power .
the smaller you make it the more quickly you can turn .
we take this curved 12-dimensional space and transform it into a flat four-dimensional space .
so one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size .
the formations can change .
so there is no global coordinate system .
and of course , it 's made exclusively for ted 2012 .
the way that urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden , and it 's not because they need to be .
and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health , we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in ireland .
i got my ph.d. studying honeybee health .
honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there .
it 's nothing to panic about . they 're all over the city .
okay let me do this differently . is anybody preferring the wonderbread at all ?
and even sort of horrible things , like picking beans by hand , can now be done automatically .
that is , historically , a really unique situation .
can you actually bake bread ? do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs ?
so we must find other solutions .
that 's where we should move .
but we can do a lot more .
it 's about sharing . it 's about honesty . it 's about identity .
but in the developing world , things are quite different .
it 's the person that 's sliding his hands up and down the levers , so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world .
and then you can also engage the end user in the design process , and not just ask him what he needs , but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved .
two animals , two iconic reptiles really captivated me very early on .
this gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes .
what 's the point of all this ?
it has remarkable features .
people scoop water out of the chambal and drink it , something you wouldn 't do in most north indian rivers .
so , we all know about the narmada river , the tragedies of dams , the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems without providing livelihoods .
thanks , rom . thanks a lot .
romulus whitaker : the real danger lurking in the water
this is one of the arteries that feed the heart , one of the main arteries , and you can see the narrowing here .
and what doesn 't work is fear of dying , and that 's what 's normally used .
you feel kind of sleepy afterwards .
it 's a half-truth . actually , americans are eating more fat than ever , and even more carbs . and so the percentage is lower , the actual amount is higher , and so the goal is to reduce both .
now , what happens to your heart when you go on an atkins diet ?
and this really got me excited because again , we found the same pattern : the more people change , the more it affected the growth of their tumors .
and so he went up on the board and he wrote the word " illness , " and circled the first letter , and then wrote the word " wellness , " and circled the first two letters ...
girl : you 're different than anybody i 've ever met .
and so david had an interesting take on the film , and he threw a challenge at us .
i 'll roll that for you now . this was the first test for benjamin button .
and the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie .
the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that come from other industries like medical imaging , the video game space , and re-appropriate them .
this is when we 're like , " ok , we 're going to be ok , this is actually going to work . "
retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model .
and then , the sauce i talked about with our technology stew -- that secret sauce was , effectively , software that allowed us to match the performance footage of brad in live action with our database of aged benjamin , the facs shapes that we had .
skin displacement : another big deal .
because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this .
and we were so unsure that this would work .
we rescued over 550 dancing bears .
and what the missionaries would do is , they 'd walk around and they 'd pick up hyena shit .
there 's also one other aspect about these camels .
hello . this is keith bellows with the national geographic camel investigation unit .
hooves ? they don 't have traditional hooves , but they do have one , like , big nail .
out !
i 'm smartly designed .
yet my large , soft feet allow me to navigate sand .
it 's a great way to start sentences .
it wants only to be here tomorrow , dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt , nose pressed against the page , writing a few more dutiful lines while i gaze out the window and imagine budapest or some other city where i have never been .
it is as if , one by one , the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones .
bc : thank you .
but did you know that at your age judy garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture , joan of arc was leading the french army to victory and blaise pascal had cleaned up his room -- no wait , i mean he had invented the calculator ?
this is the launch of my book .
if you ask anyone , " what is morality based on ? "
why would that be ? well that probably has to do with reciprocity .
but it shows the understanding that he has , because he puts his big foot on the rope , stands on the rope and waits there for the other , and then the other is going to do all the work for him .
humans yawn when others yawn .
and we call them into a room and do experiments with them .
it 's as if they 're saying , " if you 're not behaving , i 'm not going to be pro-social today . "
then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens .
i think morality is much more than what i 've been talking about , but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates , which are empathy and consolation , pro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness .
so , notice that , as more people join in , it 's less risky .
it was really a fascinating journey .
i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .
my cholesterol went down , i lost weight , my wife stopped telling me that i looked pregnant .
and this , over the years , can cause real damage , cardiovascular damage .
so thank you very much .
so the media oversimplified a few things , but in the end , it 's just a news story .
like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain .
so he 's calling oxytocin " the moral molecule . "
if someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it , don 't just take them at their word .
given that it was such a vast civilization , you might expect to find really powerful rulers , kings , and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings .
here 's a replica of one such seal .
i don 't mean the software ; i mean an ancient artifact that contains in the same text both a known text and an unknown text .
oh , it 's almost 50 / 50 . okay .
here are some examples .
and both of these are very , very flexible , which is why you find them in the very high range .
we went back and looked at where these particular texts were found , and it turns out that they were found very , very far away from the indus valley .
you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense .
these are our ancestors -- yours and mine .
well the answer is the science of radio astronomy .
fast-forward 50 years , and bell and watson 's technology has completely transformed global communications .
and so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings , get the disk kind of operational again , normal operations would resume .
they actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that .
who 's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings -- if you 're different from all the other beings ?
and then it 's never good enough .
so , compassion means to feel the feelings of others , and the human being actually is compassion .
this next is the sudanese girl , a few moments from death , a vulture hovering in the background , a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty .
or if you take eglantyne jebb , the woman who created save the children 90 years ago .
nelson mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all .
you cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources .
so my argument today is basically this .
you have to go to the literature and look up what 's known about feet .
and in fact , the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot .
it 's a shrimp-like animal called the stomatopod , and here 's how it moves on the beaches of panama : it actually rolls , and it can even roll uphill .
rf : so if you look carefully at this , what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago , no one knew what they did .
now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn 't mean you can climb vertical surfaces .
so to our blueprint , let 's attach claws .
they can run up a surface at a meter per second , take 30 steps in that one second -- you can hardly see them .
i think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research -- we just wondered how they climbed up something -- can lead to things that you could never imagine .
here you see it , next , going up the side of a building at stanford .
dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation .
how about the setting in which animals need to use this call ?
and if we look at a very pristine environment like western australia , lars bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin-watching boats .
the top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males .
nobody sang the old ones .
in the low frequencies , this line indicates sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth .
same thing in the north atlantic , in the ' 50s versus 2000 .
it turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time , and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision .
roy gould : less than a year from now , the world is going to celebrate the international year of astronomy , which marks the 400th anniversary of galileo 's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope .
we 're going to have a personal universe .
educator roy gould and researcher curtis wong show a sneak preview of microsoft 's worldwide telescope , which compiles images from telescopes and satellites to build a comprehensive , interactive view of our universe .
there 's something i 'm developing here called social intensity syndrome , which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating .
so what 's the solution ? it 's not my job .
i 'll show you something -- a little more of a concrete example here , as this thing loads .
jeff han : i 'm a research scientist at nyu in new york .
and then what i can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time .
don 't worry .
what if none of these things is the problem ?

now , one more time , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you 've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life . ok ?
and then it comes to rest . just a little thing about time .
which is again exploring space , or the lines in space .
well , because then it tells me the truth , instead of me imposing the truth .

one of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can 't see . my son asked me this the other day , he said , " dad , can you remember what i was like when i was two ? "
you can 't see light . when it 's dark , in a vacuum , if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes , you won 't see it . slightly technical , some physicists will disagree with this .
you can 't see a point . it 's by definition dimensionless , like an electron , oddly enough .
now the problem is there 's an x-axis for that , which is the practical axis .
we 're going to try science . "
as of about six months ago , the state of the art in this field is that you would , for instance , go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair , and you 'd say , " steve , you 're an expert on the irregular verbs .
people were walking around obsessed .
for instance , here 's the trajectory of marc chagall , an artist born in 1887 .
el so culturomics is what we call this method .
there 's various types of frustration .

and i 'll try to do all that in 20 minutes . i have two affiliations .
and so i fell in love with this , and said look , we have all this knowledge about brains . how hard can it be ?
maybe we 'll learn something really useful about it , but it 's interesting and fascinating .
some people say , well , we don 't still have enough data , we need to get more information , there 's all these things we don 't know .
i 've got this experience , i 'm in the world , you know .
evolution 's the same thing . we taught our kids , well , the bible says , you know , god created all these species , cats are cats , dogs are dogs , people are people , plants are plants , they don 't change .

it 's sitting there saying , ah , i 'm going to memorize all the things that are going on : where i 've been , people i 've seen , things i 've heard , and so on .
now , the engineering approach to this , the ai approach to this , is to build a door database . it has all the door attributes .
and the framework is a memory framework , not a computation or behavior framework . it 's a memory framework .
what is this going to result in ? are we going to really build intelligent machines ?
and i 'm most excited about how we 're going to use them in science .
i was thinking about the recent ongoings in congress , where the president is offering to try to get the start vote .
and he says , " but i have become skeptical .
they call her the " tree lady , " but she 's more than the tree lady .
she is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy , about how you bring democracy to the country , about educating , about how to vote -- but that democracy is not just about voting ; it 's about being an active citizen .

she managed to study english and learn that as a foreign language .
what happens when you combine these technologies together : increasing availability of facial data ; improving facial recognizing ability by computers ; but also cloud computing , which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three-letter agencies ; and ubiquitous computing , which allows my phone , which is not a supercomputer , to connect to the internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds ?
we included in this information some references to some funny , absolutely legal , but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online .
now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight .
when someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data , consider that in the last 20 years , researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy-preserving manner .
however , in the book , he also offers us a way out of that society , similar to the path that adam and eve had to follow to leave the garden .
and so he goes around the room , and then as he 's leaving the diner , he first-names almost everybody he 's just met .
you see these cars that drive up -- usually it 's saabs and audis and volvos , because in certain neighborhoods it 's socially acceptable to have a luxury car , so long as it comes from a country hostile to u.s. foreign policy -- that 's fine .

and one of the most beautiful descriptions i 've come across in this research of how minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named douglas hofstadter at the university of indiana .
shaheen 's background i don 't even know .
we , as a society , we have phds in victimizing a victim .
and one day she gives up on you and me , because we have no options for her .

ironically , hardly anyone noticed at the time .
here 's professor langdon examining a gps dot , which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe , but we know that in the world of nonfiction , the gps dot is impossible , right ?
" he didn 't see anything obvious , and he said he 'd have to take the car apart piece by piece . "
its jamming signals don 't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car .
can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a gps receiver just like that , with a spoofer ?
i saw the gps-derived timing of the new york stock exchange being manipulated by hackers .
we call ourselves pors and rao , and we live and work in india .
so we had these panels on three walls of a room .
and you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
that 's my colleague . he 's let it go .
okay , i 'm reading that at about 75 to 25 in favor at the start .
now , from an environmental standpoint , the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal , the two major sources of electricity .
in terms of weapons , the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy .
and it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation .
in 2020 , the number will go down to 15,000 due to improvements .
and you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with .
all right .
there 's absolutely no need for nuclear power .
for .
because five years from now , it will blow you away what we 'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible , disastrous nuclear power .
there 's plenty of resource . you can make it reliable .
the analogy for me is alaska . you know , we bought alaska .
they didn 't know what couldn 't be done .
we know -- 20 million dollars today , you can go and buy a ticket , but how cheap could it get ?
and of course , we had beautiful spaceshipone , which made those two flights and won the competition .
orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station .
this is what happens when you put up a prize , when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials .
our next giant leap
and as we 're seeking to make something three-dimensional , we start not with a single surface , but with a volume .
white surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones .
in this case , the process is deterministic .
and the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again .
and here we are at 2010 , average life expectancy of a child born today , age 79 , and we are not done yet .
ultimately , maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these , and if all goes well , 14 years after you started , you will get one approval .
only about one in every four million kids has this disease , and in a simple way , what happens is , because of a mutation in a particular gene , a protein is made that 's toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate .
so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4,000 that are waiting for answers .
suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
i think it 'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we 're trying to do here and why it matters .
and we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance .
i think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally .
in a few days , we will be opening the arab museum of modern art .
play by yourself then .
sheikha al mayassa , a patron of artists , storytellers and filmmakers in qatar , talks about how art and culture create a country 's identity -- and allow every country to share its unique identity with the wider world . as she says : " we don 't want to be all the same , but we do want to understand each other . "
i told her i couldn 't face it because the way the teacher was treating me , ridiculing me , and using me as an example of failure .
and they moved in , and decided not to pay me any rent .
so i got the teddy bear and i said , " do you mind if i pull out one of your fibers ? "
gone .
what i did , i plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope .
even though they get on our nerves , i would never kill an insect because , " all creatures great and small " -- there is a hymn that says that .
when the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers .
that one is , more or less , the same type of process .

i was like , " david cries when you invite him to take a walk . "
at the risk of admission , i was never nicer than the year i was on crutches .
so i stand here today as you see now , walking without crutches or a cane .
and nanny 's great insight , really , was to think , here 's a child who can 't see .
and having said to your dad , nick , that i would try to teach you , i was then slightly confused as to how i might go about that if i wasn 't allowed near the piano .
it 's no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique , and luckily , derek , you decided that , once we did start learning , you 'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings .
and i say , " no , it 's not brave at all , because if you ask for something that derek doesn 't know , you 're invited to come and sing it first , and then he 'll pick it up . "
the ted people will kill me , but perhaps there 's time for one encore .
it is a design that challenges your intuition -- it is not what you think it is when you first see it .

everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying , " look at the difference we 've made . "
it 's very encouraging .
if we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints , if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don 't buy the things that are not , we can change the world overnight .
and so what we do is , we start simple and we work our way up to living systems .
so just through self-assembly , mixing things together in the lab , we can come up with , say , a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body , right ?
so then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do , and depending on the conditions , we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment .
think of it like a primordial ooze , okay ?
basically what that means is , you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to maintain itself .
so all of those -- what 's common about all of those ?
very lucky .
we take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice .
somehow buying a local lettuce , changing a light bulb , driving the speed limit , changing your tires regularly , doesn 't seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis .
and we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we 've pulled out of the air .
recorded voice : tick , tick , tick .
in this case , instead of throwing chewing gum , or doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- there 's a body of water in iceland that i 've been dealing with that 's in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution , it 's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .
did you know that today we maintain a global herd of 60 billion animals to provide our meat , dairy , eggs and leather goods ?

he didn 't write " little red laptop computer " or " little red dirt devil . "
hy-wire is the world 's first drivable fuel cell , and we have followed up that now with sequel .
so that 's what we 're driving to for 2010 .
are you serious about it , and not just , you know , when the consumers want it , when the regulators force us to do it we will go there ?
not so much .
and so every year , i share my background with my kids , because they need to know that everyone has a story , everyone has a struggle , and everyone needs help along the way .
so even though teachers were against it because we employ one-year contracts -- you can 't teach , or you don 't want to teach , you don 't get to be at my school with my kids .

to build development , brazilian development , we destroyed a lot of our forest .
and i wanted to see us when we used , yes , our instruments in stone .
for the water system , the trees are essential .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here .
how does it work to make habitat for animals like me ? "
and just beyond it you can see features that have vanished , things that have disappeared .
we compiled all the information about where the native americans were , the lenape .
here is the beaver . and here is the stream , and the aspen and the alder and the willow .
so then we took the muir webs and we took them back to the maps .
and we can see this in the geography of the city today .
when i 'm starting talks like this , i usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there don 't know what that is .
and there 's more and more people on the way . right ?
talk about the kinds of things we 're scoping out .
green roofs . bill mcdonough covered that last night , so i won 't dwell on that too much .
so we have a model in potential , an emerging model that we 're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in , and turn them into bright green cities .
and those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don 't have capital . right ?
another world is possible .
it 's the greenest building in the world .
how do we help people like that ?
worldchanging.com founder alex steffen argues that reducing humanity 's ecological footprint is incredibly vital now , as the western consumer lifestyle spreads to developing countries .
and you 'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law , but congress seems not to have let that bother them too much .
taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay .
we share written things , we share images , we share audio , we share video .
you don 't have millions and millions of dollars , but you can call your representatives , and you can remind them that you vote , and you can ask not to be treated like a thief , and you can suggest that you would prefer that the internet not be broken .
time warner has called and they want us all back on the couch , just consuming -- not producing , not sharing -- and we should say , " no . "

how fabulous . why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car ?
whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies will be happening with road pricing .
zero dollars a month .
and why is this going to happen ? because we 're going to do congestion pricing , we are going to do road tolls , gas taxes are going to become road pricing .
so , let 's take control of this nightmare : implement a gas tax immediately ; transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh ; require that the mesh be open to all , with open standards ; and , of course , use mesh networks .
we actually saw seals out of our car window , and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads .

i don 't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you 're in your mid-20s .
he 's like , " do you know where morocco even is ? "
we 've got all that , but we 've only got 100 years to enjoy it .
tourist : it 's reality , it 's us . it happened here .
we were really paralyzed .
and i sat in on several meetings .
there was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience .
and atlantic-heydt , who 's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country , volunteered to do it at cost .
we knew that one way or another this was going to happen .
and kevin kennon , rick scofidio , liz diller and all the people within the city -- norman lear , who i spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding , offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it .
dr : i think there 's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities .

would it be crazy to know , 103 gs .
so i may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child .
it died in large part because it lacked constituent buy-in ; it lacked stakeholder traction .
so i was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is .
and here 's the truth : doodling is an incredibly powerful tool , and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn .
because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form , it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy .
prices for arvs , the drugs needed to treat hiv , cost about 12,000 [ dollars ] per patient per year .
this is what you see today , and this is in developing countries , so what that means is , unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now , we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis , because new drugs are developed , new drugs go to market , but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries .
he has access to antiretroviral drugs .
we are used to looking at charts like that , and you see this red line showing the air temperature in june and july , and yes , that 's right , it 's picking up to 45 degrees c.
if we overlay what happens during the football world cup , what will happen in june , july , we will see , yes , air temperature will be much higher , but because the games and the plays will be in the afternoon , it 's probably the same comfort rating we 've found in other places which has perceived as non-comfortable .
we are not borrowing energy from our neighbors .
so this man , his name is sathi shri .
basically , you don 't have to necessarily buy brand new things . you have condemned computers that are stripped apart , and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration .
the only thing that they don 't have is access to resources . they don 't even have a textbook sometimes , and they don 't even have a proper curriculum .
it might take a few days to get there , but at least it gets there in high definition and in a reliable quality .

this here shows , on the y-axis , the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and , on the x-axis , the degrees of separation between the two people .
now , i want to be very clear : we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all .
but we don 't just experience them , we show them .
and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .
but now we , with a bird 's eye view looking at this network , can see that they occupy very different social worlds .
they 're both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphite , which is soft and dark .
you hear about it all the time .
study after study is coming to the same conclusion .
now it 's really too simplistic to say that older people are " happy . "
we might learn something unexpected .
anybody ? anybody ? yeah !

the court determined that , when the sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders , the terms of the second fort laramie treaty had been violated .
this is the legacy of manifest destiny .
aaron huey 's effort to photograph poverty in america led him to the pine ridge indian reservation , where the struggle of the native lakota people -- appalling , and largely ignored -- compelled him to refocus . five years of work later , his haunting photos intertwine with a shocking history lesson in this bold , courageous talk . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
flash forward : 1960 , 24 percent child mortality has dropped to 6.5 percent today .
on medicaid -- if you 're fairly poor you get medicaid , or if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward .
that 's complex , but it 's manageable .
now , the model is intuitively right .
so , let 's dial this back . that 's what ? fifth grade ? fourth grade ?
they are situations where the mental model doesn 't match the reality .
fifty versus 35 , that 's a big move . eleven versus nine ? come on .
so far , i 've been pretty negative .
this is from a company called positive energy .

alright sendhil , thanks so much for coming to ted . thank you .
so if i take this salt dough , again , it 's like the play-dough you probably made as kids , and i plug it in -- it 's a two-lead battery pack , simple battery pack , you can buy them at radio shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up .

they say three percent of the population likes classical music .
that 's a totally different world .
and when i got to law school , i didn 't do very well .
you look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks .
and what 's interesting about this experiment is that it 's not an aberration .
the solution is not over here . the solution is on the periphery .
let me give you an example of what i mean .
last month , just last month , economists at lse looked at 51 studies of pay-for-performance plans , inside of companies .
let me give you some examples of some kind of radical notions of self-direction .
they don 't have to be in the office at a certain time , or any time .
autonomy , mastery and purpose , versus carrot and sticks . and who wins ?

this is a little stone ball , floating .
it was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure .
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations .
the default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution earth image .
i want to talk about how the things we 've been taught to think about giving and about charity and about the nonprofit sector are actually undermining the causes we love and our profound yearning to change the world .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
do you know how many people we would have gotten if we put up flyers in the laundromat ?
all of the scale goes to coca-cola and burger king .
but if it 's a logical world in which investment in fundraising actually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger , then we have it precisely backwards , and we should be investing more money , not less , in fundraising , because fundraising is the one thing that has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply .
but only about 20 percent of that , or 60 billion dollars , goes to health and human services causes .
or rather a cubicle , an open-space cubicle , with a lot of space .
so that 's a sort of a tradition .
riccardo muti , please .

let 's see another super-conductor , a german super-conductor . herbert von karajan , please .
and he cues in a flute player like this .
and that 's what makes them into partners .
let 's see the next video , please . see what happens here .
but you need to have process and content to create the meaning .
some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us .
completely unprecedented , historically .
it 's something that was unimaginable to people then .
and it is something which has several characteristics .
there was a degree of resilience , if you like , at that time , which we can now only look back on with envy .
planting productive trees throughout urban spaces .
stories about the community that 's produced its own 21 pound note , for example , the school that 's turned its car park into a food garden , the community that 's founded its own energy company .
so this is combining the federal level , which is the largest , the state level and the local level .

three million set aside , 62 billion dollar liability -- much worse than the car companies .
so what 's going on ?
and finally , we need to really reward politicians .
and it 's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
and at the very core of this crisis of mine , i felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , i felt what skid row really needed was somebody like paul farmer and not another classical musician playing on bunker hill .
here 's my clock .
to do this , i devised something called the five senses graph .
that is , of course , sex . great sex .

we get jealous , not because we 're evil , but because we have little artists pent up inside us .
this devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can 't write : " people will laugh at you . this is not good writing !
so in response to such a pragmatic question , we need to be bold .
just do it !
in 1981 , we published an article in science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing co2 .
let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics -- first , from earth 's energy balance and , second , from earth 's climate history .
this shows that the effect of the sun 's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses , mainly from burning fossil fuels .
where you are sitting now would be under water .
this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations , creating millions of jobs .
thank you .
he worked with john wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see in the westerns . yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated .
we can do bigger car stunts than ever before now .
i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are .
this is a shot of " terminator , " the movie .
they first dropped some dummies .
certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly .
it 's a three sided box , basically .
then they 're comfortable , they have good vision , like this great big visor .

anyway , he was really upset on the plane , and he said , " i 'll never find another girl like sarah . "
they 're disembodied , you know , in a kind of literal way .
but now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games , because you need an ma where the previous job required a ba , and now you need a phd for the other .
she 's wonderful . i used to be on the board of the royal ballet in england , as you can see .
we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we 've talked about . and the only way we 'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are . and our task is to educate their whole being , so they can face this future .
now , the american head of programming wanted new local arabic comedy .
i happened to find a funny guy to present it in arabic , who is originally korean , a perfect fit for the axis of evil .

this is obviously not one of them .
here we 're talking about traffic jams , or sometimes detours , or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions .
i think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years , but i 'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who 's thought a lot about changes in concepts and changes in technology .
how are you going to replicate ? "
although they are like in different contexts , one is magical , the other two are like investigation , i like those books because they have something special in them .

i can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the bigs , going into management ain 't no success story . it 's a failure .

and earlier this year , he got a request from the green party in australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resulted in the australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world .
they don 't like that . they think it 's crank . i don 't think it 's crank .
so it may be good for the waistline , but it probably won 't keep you satiated for very long .
they look -- maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished , abridged perhaps , but in fact , in fact they are the -- they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea , right up there with flat fish .
how do you get insight ?
and you know , the locals think it 's terrible behavior , it 's just horrible watching this happen , day after day .
and in showing you this , you know , when we 're looking at this data , we 're thinking , oh do these animals , do they cross the equator ?
i set up a website because i was getting so many questions about molas and sunfish .
and from that , the on-board micro-controllers can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations .
nick sears : demo : the orb
under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously .
very confused at what we humans call justice .
hitler knew it ; he used wagner to make all the nazis feel wonderful and aryan .

all the germs from the water we take .

so june 1945 -- actually , the bomb hasn 't even been dropped yet -- and von neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing , which also goes back to turing , who , before that , gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless , little , finite state machine , just reading a tape in and reading a tape out .

being a victim of hacking for a change .

in china , in russia and in loads of other countries that are developing cyber-offensive capabilities , this is exactly what they are doing .
so strictly from a climate change perspective , the cities are already relatively green .
since 2000 , already two-thirds of households in suburbia we just haven 't caught up with the actual realities of this .
we also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools , lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one .
by 1980 , it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right .
it 's providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle .
this is another re-greening example .
now , retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism , and not without reason ; you don 't get much more phony than an astroturf town green .
there is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them .
in great neck , new york , they call it a " pussy-cat . "
and that 's where the deepest happiness has actually come from .
and i was taken to the secret ice cream-eating place in a little town , where we went to a back room , and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us , and they were served vanilla ice cream .
she was 14 years old , and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis , and she couldn 't get out because she was addicted to the relationship and she had no money . her sister was younger than her and she applied -- we had a " stop rape " contest a few years ago in new york -- and she applied , hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister .
so we bought her a jeep . and in the year that she had the jeep , she saved 4,500 girls from being cut . so then we said to her , " agnes , well , what else could we do for you ? " and she said , " well , eve , you know , if you gave me some money , i could open a house and girls could run away and they could be saved . "
" yo napot , pacak ! " which , as somebody here must surely know , means " what 's up , guys ?

and he called his top assistant to him and asked , " where would you say , in this region , racism is most virulent ? "
in his eighties , mr. teszler , having retired from the textile industry , adopted wofford college , auditing courses every semester , and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved , becoming affectionately known as " opi " -- which is magyar for grandfather -- by all and sundry . before i got there , the library of the college had been named for mr. teszler , and after i arrived in 1993 , the faculty decided to honor itself by naming mr. teszler professor of the college -- partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses in the catalog , but mainly because he was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us .

pietro was suspicious of formal art training , art history training , because he feared that it filled people up with jargon , and then they just classified things rather than looking at them , and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary , and he wanted us to use our eyes , and he was especially evangelical about this message , because he was losing his sight .
the exhibition was designed to be an experience , and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs .
the met was set up not as a museum of american art , but of an encyclopedic museum , and today , 140 years later , that vision is as prescient as ever , because , of course , we live in a world of crisis , of challenge , and we 're exposed to it through the 24 / 7 newsreels .

we get unbelievable segregation .
you can see the deadlines and the usage graph .
so they get to try again , and this time they got it right .

so you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis-driven mode to the data-driven mode , a transformation that , for example , has revolutionized biology .

by having this amazing content be available , we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted , whether it 's just to expand our minds or it 's to change our lives .
and secondly , i 'm a recovering narcissist .
you know , because -- and by the way to i was so grateful to dean kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons , that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don 't enter the fields of science and technology -- because for instance , the reason i don 't do math is , i was taught to do math and read at the same time .

and i share with you some very high-definition video that we collected in real time .
for a variety of reasons they 're dangerous , but we feel that ooi , this ocean observatory initiative , which the national science foundation has begun to fund , has the potential to really transform things .
and the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table .
and this is the kind of activity that we can see with high-definition video , because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to 10 stereo hd systems running continuously and , again , directed through robotic techniques from land .
so the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented .
he won the nobel prize for literature in 1948 .
so , anything that has been made can be unmade .
it 's been missing in much of the architecture , because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered , the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion , that has no value .

and so i tell people , well , i was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one .
em : absolutely . so the thing about rockets is that they 're all expendable .

it is physics . you know , the sort of first principles reasoning .

well now , finally what about funny . my answer is , it 's the same story , the same story .
and there should be a pencil .
before founding ideo , david said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends .
thank you . all right .
so we have the finger blasters . other people have dinosaurs , you know .
any parents of young kids in the audience ? there must be some .
anybody use my examples ? the sun and the football ?
and so , some of the things that they figured out , some of these individuals figured out ; in one case , a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients ; a design of a solar space probe experiment ; a redesign of the linear electron accelerator ; an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder -- you can tell this is a while ago ; the completion of a line of furniture ; and even a new conceptual model of the photon .
and they were doing that through building prototypes .
they don 't necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop to do it .
because when children play a role , they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they 've learnt from us as adults .
we 're trying on these experiences .
i think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of -- i think what 's very different about design is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation .
but then i stopped , because i figured , " oh , you know , i made it .
he said , " no . but it can buy prozac . "
so here is to your continued success .
they opened their scores , the conductor gave the downbeat , and boom , they launched into the kyrie from the " requiem " by mozart .
and i sent out this call to singers .
he made sure that everything lined up .
and there were 900 people involved in that .
and the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection .
but i also realized that there is one thing that i could give you .
both good long-term and short-term effects and a positive intention like fred stutzman 's freedom , where the whole point of that application is , well , we 're usually so bombarded with calls and requests by other people , with this device you can shut off the internet connectivity of your pc of choice for a preset amount of time to actually get some work done .
we 're fishing at the low end .
no matter whether we as designers intend it or not , we materialize morality .
this is buster setting up a pull-up machine at the office of his new startup habit labs , where they 're trying to build up other applications like health month for people .
and that 's exactly what we were aiming for .
from daphne koller and andrew ng , we learned the concept of " flipping " the classroom .
so come up afterwards and i 'll show you how to play a lobster .
we simply couldn 't capture it on video .
and actually , this work was done in the 1960s by a famous biologist named malcolm burrows .
so , we 've had very solid evidence showing that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends , and does , in fact , function as a spring .
i purchased a 100-pound load cell , thinking , no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal .
and cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds .
and this is quite interesting , to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what 's really , in all species , their spring .
and the next lines are , " through the unknown remembered gate , where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning . "
this , i think , represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built .
and we 're only just beginning to grasp it .
there 're no silly buoyancy tanks -- it 's permanently , positively buoyant .
but after that encounter i really did want to go back with that animal and dance .
graham hawkes takes us aboard his graceful , winged submarines to the depths of planet ocean . it 's a deep blue world we landlubbers rarely see in 3d .
now the gowanus is particularly smelly -- i will admit it .
and they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem .
and this glorious , readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below .
but it was also the largest city that had ever been built .
and he 'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies , but nothing had really stuck .
and you can see in this map , the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about 15 people dead .
so for the last 20 years , since my dental experience , i have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people .
and this is a little girl .
this is moi . this is in the ecuadorian amazon .
so it was a great experience for him . he stayed up all night with them , drumming and dancing .
and the way we do it is , we do it in workshops , and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling , and have them work with the kids .
thank you very much .
it 's a very large number of galaxies .
and so that 's the sort of sequence , and so i have a more artistic impression of this .
and this wastebasket part , that 's to represent what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period .
now we 're going to fly through it at warp a million .
and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right .
now we 're into a distance sort of between here and here .
you see how the filament -- you see how several filaments are coming together , therefore making this supercluster of galaxies .
and it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now , in terms of its expansion .
we live in an incredibly busy world .
you get stressed , you do some meditation .
but we need to know how to do it .
but what do you do every 20 , 30 seconds ?
and after spending all my life wanting to do art , i left art school , and then i left art completely .
and it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands .
so i organized candles on a table , i lit them , and then blew them out , then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles , then assembled the videos into the larger image .
phil hansen : embrace the shake
now around chernobyl , there are scattered ghost villages , eerily silent , strangely charming , bucolic , totally contaminated .
health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught .
chernobyl was the site of the world 's worst nuclear accident and , for the past 27 years , the area around the plant has been known as the exclusion zone . and yet , a community of about 200 people live there -- almost all of them elderly women . these proud grandmas defied orders to relocate because their connection to their homeland and to their community are " forces that rival even radiation . "
over the past 15 years , i 've studied technologies of mobile communication and i 've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people , young and old , about their plugged in lives .
when he goes to work , he doesn 't stop by to talk to anybody , he doesn 't call .
connecting in sips may work for gathering discreet bits of information , they may work for saying , " i 'm thinking about you , " or even for saying , " i love you , " -- i mean , look at how i felt when i got that text from my daughter -- but they don 't really work for learning about each other , for really coming to know and understand each other .
so during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy , i was thinking , " that robot can 't empathize .
but more than a symptom , constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves .
and we 're afraid , like young lovers , that too much talking might spoil the romance .
and then there 's technology -- simpler , hopeful , optimistic , ever-young .
and i knew how mr. webster defined it : as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige , or something of that sort -- worthy accomplishments perhaps , but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success .
coal oil lamp -- we didn 't have electricity in our farm home .
so i let them -- just they had to be neat and clean .
and those actually came from my dad .
" sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can 't win , is the fates themselves that miss .
i believe it was -- one great philosopher said -- no , no , cervantes . cervantes said , " the journey is better than the end . "
when i saw them as freshmen , on our freshmen team -- we didn 't have -- freshmen couldn 't play varsity when i taught .
so that 's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine .
liver cells , nerve cells , pancreatic cells -- we still can 't grow them even today .
we then place it in an oven-like device , and we 're able to create that structure and bring it out .
and there 's a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through .
so the strategy here is -- this is actually a ct scan , an x-ray -- and we go layer by layer , using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient 's own kidneys .
and this is actually a very brief clip -- only about 30 seconds -- of a patient who actually received an organ .
je : and tony 's done hundreds of these ?
now my husband , chris , and i love this show .
we 're bartering , trading , swapping , sharing , but they 're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms .
all of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008 , when , of course , the great financial crash happened .
that matches mr. jones , with some spare space in his back garden , with mrs. smith , a would-be grower .
but my favorite statistic is that 100 out of the 250 participants did not want their keys back .
now mark my words , it 's only a matter of time before we 're going to be able to perform a google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital .
and all of a sudden i passed the national examination , found myself in a very beautiful high school in kenya .
you 've got a good education from america , you have a good life in america ; what are you going to do for us ?
caitria o 'neill : that was me in front of our house in monson , massachusetts last june .
mo : so we started organizing .
co : you sent me to that place on washington street yesterday , and now i 'm covered in poison ivy .
co : the timing .
alvin , our software engineer and cofounder , has built these tools .
because it doesn 't take harvard or mit to fly in and fix problems after a disaster , it takes a local .
today -- a billion squatters , one in six people on the planet .
as we passed , two boys were climbing the mount kenya of trash .
they develop -- you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other , room , after room , after room .
this is a marketplace , also in kenya , toi market , lots of dealers , in almost everything you want to buy .
turkey has two great laws that protect squatters .
robert neuwirth , author of " shadow cities , " finds the world 's squatter sites -- where a billion people now make their homes -- to be thriving centers of ingenuity and innovation . he takes us on a tour .
when i was in high school , i got my first philips reel-to-reel tape recorder , and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer medium of learning .
it was invented by russell smith , a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people .
it 's called jaws , job access with speech , and it sounds like this .
for example , australia , like about one third of the world 's countries , has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled or read for we blind persons .
ron mccallum : how technology allowed me to read
and there 's tremendous scope for additional private help here , because the government has dropped the ball on much of this , i 'm afraid .
now , for about 200 years , people have been saying exactly what i 'm telling you -- the age of technological unemployment is at hand — starting with the luddites smashing looms in britain just about two centuries ago , and they have been wrong .
and artists who were formerly constrained can now do things that were never , ever possible for them before .
so this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about .
so with these challenges , what do we do about them ?
we 're facing very tough challenges .
i 've been a priest in the church for 20 years .
if the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers , holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now , there are no words that we could say to him .
i very much relate to this idea of god .
so the next question is about partiality .
we must think again about god .
i don 't know .
only doubts and questioning and uncertainty .
my friend danny hillis says kind of a similar one , he says , " technology is anything that doesn 't work yet . "
some anthropologists call that the original affluent society .
in fact , our humanity , and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we 've invented .
the amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence .
i did a survey of a number of species of artifacts in my house , and there 's 6,000 . other people have come up with 10,000 .
so , maybe spraying ddt on crops is a really bad idea .
kevin kelly : technology 's epic story
and so we started talking about this .
and so this is what we did . so it made everybody laugh , and we said , " there 's a point to that .
and everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited , really , where nobody came in .
they 're all working next to each other . it 's all a creative endeavor .
this is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
so this is the everett middle school writers ' room , where we decorated it in buccaneer style .
so we sell ' em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . the store , actually -- even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money .
this is sam potts ' great design that did this .
it 's very busy . same principles : one-on-one attention , complete devotion to the students ' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
anyway . so i 'm going to jump ahead .
you can do and use the skills that you have .
i am another image and vision of another survivor of war .
we have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics , tactics , weapons , dollars and casualties .
we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars .
there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don 't start investing in women and girls .
ideas , language , even the phrase ' each other ' no longer makes any sense . "
so , i went to the cape last summer to hide from simplicity , and i went to the gap , because i only have black pants .
we 're human beings : we love complex things .
we were a great model . so , i loved going to school .
the t doesn 't stand for " human , " it stands for " technology . "
so this is the leaves in my yard , essentially .
but i thought , " this is very interesting . what if i make like a car crash test ? "
sometimes , they find a hair in the food . that 's my hair .
so , if i simplify the laws of simplicity , i have what 's called the cookie versus laundry thing .
you know , i have a lot of cocky freshmen at mit , so i tell them , " oh , your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger , but in your late twenties and mid-thirties , cells , they die . "
optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
to put it in perspective , 2005 was the previous record .
well , the alliance for climate protection , which i head in conjunction with current tv -- who did this pro bono -- did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this .
and it is based on an old model .
we have the capacity to do it .
have a moratorium -- we shouldn 't have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren 't able to capture and store co2 , which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources .
and what i 'm going to do today is i 'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that i 'm working on , which is called " design and the elastic mind . "
and designers would like , oh , i don 't know how to do an equation , i don 't understand what you 're saying . and then all of a sudden they really started talking each others ' language , and now we 're already at the point that they collaborate .
but the problem is that it 's a really ugly patty .
another aspect of contemporary design that i think is mind-opening , promising and will really be the future of design , is the idea of collective design .
and here i 'm showing a picture that was in wired magazine -- you know , the artifacts of the future section that i love so much -- that shows you can have your desktop 3d printer and print your own basketball .
you need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something .
but i 'm hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going -- which is always , hopefully , a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going .
that database contained the timing of attacks , the location , the size and the weapons used .
and yet the fundamental patterns underlying them are the same .
and it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy .
and so i 'm thinking , right , great , it 's going to keep going down .
and all the main religions have similar teachings .
so , god thought , " nope , i 'm going to create the world just with compassion . "
and that unity is something that connects all of creation .
and he rushed home . and after the sabbath , he made 12 loaves of bread , took them to the synagogue , went into the synagogue , opened the ark and said , " god , i don 't know why you want this bread , but here you are . "
and he called the two of them to his office .
it persists for months and oftentimes for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
but the worst part was , not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
what can we do in a case like chandler 's ?
we all live here in boulder .
there is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock , and in fact , if any of you have ever been to near winslow , arizona , there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called meteor crater .
so , now that i 've scared the crap out of you ...
and it 's going to pass us so close that it 's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites .
you can try to -- you know , if you watch the movies , you might think about , why don 't we use a nuclear weapon ?
so think about this , right ?
seen from another point of view , it gives quite a different impression .
once they threaten your advertisers , market forces are actually , you know , destroyed , and the advertisers do not want to come -- no matter how much does it make sense for them -- do not want to come and advertise .
actually , i underestimated the atrocities , i have to admit .
first , under no circumstances i want to hang myself .
a lot of numbers there . a lot of numbers .
i 'll bet half of you have never heard of that place .
but there is a second angle to that .
we 've decided to do it this fall ; we will issue them , probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars .
sasa vucinic : why we should invest in a free press
now , yeah , what do we mean by beautiful ? that 's one thing .
now , some people call that a theory of everything .
and that 's why the equations look so simple .
then , using vector analysis , you use rotational symmetry , and you get this next set .
proximate self-similarity . and that accounts for this phenomenon .
you don 't need -- you don 't need something more to get something more .
but it wasn 't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame -- what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it .
and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide .
he never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights .
his story would be told .
and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation .
so as for that third sphere of play , which he never had learned to enjoy , i 've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy -- enough so that a hobby , a sport , a love of music , or art , or literature , or any form of recreation , can provide true pleasure , relaxation and replenishment .
it all began when i was only six years old , and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games -- so that when he went to work in new york during the day , i could record for him the history of that afternoon 's brooklyn dodgers game .
and then came my second sin .
the things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us .
and that very night cyrus , king of the persians , entered babylon and the whole regime of belshazzar fell .
this is the jewish version of the same story .
the greek invasions ended that .
marduk tells cyrus that he will do these great , generous things of setting the people free .
and another story of the cylinder begins .
it became a great emblem , a great subject of debate about what iran is at home and abroad .
most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children .
over the next few days , i began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional .
behind each of the million children in institutions , there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options , like natalia in moldova , who only had enough money to feed her baby , and so had to send her older son to the institution ; or desi , in bulgaria , who looked after her four children at home until her husband died , but then she had to go out to work full time , and with no support , felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution ; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they 're pregnant , who leave their babies in a hospital ; or the new parents , the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability , and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child 's potential , are told by the doctors , " forget her , leave her in the institution , go home and make a healthy one . "
and when i was 12 , i became an actor .
there was no starting point for peace .
and of course we didn 't have the money ; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [ this mail ] .
so mary robinson , she said to me , " listen , this is an idea whose time has come . this must be created . "
because we 've got to stop , we 've got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that , as a young person , is confusing me .
and i felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did , then maybe we wouldn 't see things like that .
because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there 'd be more -- when we got into certain areas , maybe there would be more people interested .
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
and then there was this other statement that came out from the u.n. department of security and safety saying that , in afghanistan , because of this work , the violence was down by 70 percent .
we 'll utilize sport and football .
if you put one drop , one drop of something , in that water , it 'll change it forever .
it seems quite vexing .
it seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain , or in any other brain for that matter .
and all of you are primates .
gorillas and orangutans , for instance , afford about 30 billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating , and that seems to be about as much as they can do .
i now look at my kitchen , and i bow to it , and i thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans .
and i thought about this concept of , imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor , modify and biologically enhance it , and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other ?
for many years , we were just providing them with artificial limbs .
i was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions .
and then i said , " oh , my god . what did i say ?
but najmuddin told me , " listen now , we 're here . "
he was coming every day , crossing the front line .
later on , we took them home .
i said , " okay . "
so the only things i could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise .
but also for the newcomers .
all we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist , to make them part of the decision-making process and then , of course , to adapt .
africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders .
you see , the folks at the ministry of health , the hospital administrators , the doctors , the nurses -- they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school .
because of his uniform they speak to him differently , and they explain to him that they 're just following orders .
and i realized just what had happened to me at swarthmore , this transformation -- the ability to confront problems , complex problems , and to design solutions to those problems .
so i decided to get engaged , and the first thing that i did was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were .
and a month into it , i come to the office , and i have this email from one of our students .
it says a lot about her .
planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling , but whose streets we can 't walk .
however , these are just the tip of the iceberg .
and it makes a very bad microphone ; i 've tried it many times .
i 'm an actor who plays a specific part .
good bye . "
and that 's the kind of information they 're going to bring back to you ?
he 's well educated , he 's smart , he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he doesn 't give a damn .
she said that , first of all , that she didn 't know how to contact me .
why don 't they affect me ?
these people don 't need the million dollars perhaps , but wouldn 't you think they 'd like to take it just to make me look silly ?
we 're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it .
and perhaps most obviously , and perhaps most importantly -- and the path to concepts that we 've heard about kind of illustrate this -- it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity , of compressed oxygen and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning of this machine .
and everything began well until the power went out .
and the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous .
and so it 's not going to break very easily , but if it does , virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver .
if more people in the health delivery space really working on some of these challenges in low-income countries could start their design process , their solution search , from outside of that proverbial box and inside of the hospital -- in other words , if we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world , rather than the one that we wished existed -- we might just save a lot of lives .
in south africa , ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes in bright colors , and the zulu women use the symbols in the beads that they weave into bracelets and necklaces .
saki mafundikwa : ingenuity and elegance in ancient african alphabets
but lists like this become kind of numbing , so let me just say this : if you 're a progressive , if you 're driving a prius , or you 're shopping green , or you 're looking for organic , you should probably be a semi-vegetarian .
two : both have been marketed heavily , creating unnatural demand .
now , my math 's a little shaky , but this is pretty good , and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long , but you get the idea .
and fancy food was entirely french .
thus arrived convenience .
there were fewer meals with home-cooked breads , desserts and soups , because all of them could be bought at any store .
the chicken is fed corn , and then its meat is ground up , and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder , and then it 's fried in corn oil .
which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue , the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food .
ann cooper 's right .
we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s .
my footprint 's smaller , i 'm lessening pollution , i feel better about the animals , i 'm even saving money .
[ company sold to facebook , june 18 , 2012 ... ] there are other companies that will place a camera like this — this has nothing to do with facebook — they take your picture , they tie it to the social media , they figure out you really like to wear black dresses , so maybe the person in the store comes up and says , " hey , we 've got five black dresses that would just look great on you . "
she kept getting distracted . he eventually won the race .
sometimes , we don 't see a problem because either it 's too familiar or it 's too big .
well , let 's first look at the probability -- and this is very , very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years , which is surprising .
or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love .
not just the world around us , but we , ourselves .
intellectual capacity -- let 's take that box , which falls into a lot of different sub-categories : memory , concentration , mental energy , intelligence , empathy .
if you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person , undiminished through time , so that wouldn 't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn 't want it to .
and i want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since i first became familiar with your work .
but with the pendulum , it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up .
ts : so something like this .
and that 's something that in painting i 've never seen done .
i mean , i 've got the symptoms .
my father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in ukraine .
then our neighbor pops her head in , and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza .
i 'm a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background .
so i decided , i 'm going to start my own biennial .
so i should start to talk about these guys .
and this piece is " frost . "
and he spends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is .
and this one had to get broken up .
there 's another pile of leaves .
and this is called " horse sense fence . "
and it 's good that she 's not real ; she 'd be mad that i said that .
if you look close , it 's this shape , called a crane .
and they 're very simple , easy to understand .
i mean , a stag beetle -- it 's got two points for jaws , it 's got antennae . can you be that specific in the detail ? "
well , there are other ways of making a flap .
so i wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called treemaker , and you can download it from my website .
well , then you could do an organ .
so , imagine a lens the size of a football field .
and this stent folds down using an origami pattern , based on a model called the water bomb base .
this is a land yacht racing across the desert in nevada .
yves behar : a supercharged motorcycle design
i myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom i dearly love .
so here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them .
what the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills .
there 's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the " boy crisis . "
the night after i talked to these college girls , i also went to a men 's group in kansas , and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which i spoke to you about earlier .
now they 've been asking a question since 1985 : " how strongly do you prefer a first-born son ? "
and also , " shattering the glass ceiling " is a terrible phrase .
instead of talking about little green men , he talked about how the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war , and now they 're projecting flying saucers into the sky .
we know the temples they built , where people could come to experience a different reality .
now , when that happens , he says the music just flows out .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappears , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that 's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
and if " where do you come from ? "
and the number of us who live outside the old nation-state categories is increasing so quickly , by 64 million just in the last 12 years , that soon there will be more of us than there are americans .
and yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it 's really hard to get your bearings when you 're in midair .
small but eminently comfortable , it had a bed and a rocking chair and a long desk and even longer picture windows looking out on a small , private , walled garden , and then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass running down to the sea .
it 's the place where you stand .
so the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this , and so the way that we 're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools , and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways .
the world population has doubled since i went to school .
and these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically .
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here -- high child-survival , small families -- and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
and look at the position of the old west .
this is looking at data from the paper about 20 years ago , but it 's true today .
high vitamin d levels , i think , are a marker for sunlight exposure , and sunlight exposure , in methods i 'm going to show , is good for heart disease .
and in edinburgh , the experimental animal we use is the medical student .
one of the subjects here was my mother-in-law , and clearly i do not know her age .
so what you can do is you can multiply those data by the no that 's released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into the circulation .
our bodies get vitamin d from the sun , but as dermatologist richard weller suggests , sunlight may confer another surprising benefit too . new research by his team shows that nitric oxide , a chemical transmitter stored in huge reserves in the skin , can be released by uv light , to great benefit for blood pressure and the cardiovascular system . what does it mean ? well , it might begin to explain why scots get sick more than australians ...
but still ways to go to get stem cells into patients , in terms of actual therapies for organs .
how does this work ? well , on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured .
this is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle .
more complex structures such as blood vessels , urethras , which i showed you , they 're definitely more complex because you 're introducing two different cell types .
but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .
this technology was developed by tao ju , who worked at our institute .
they are actually making urine .
so , these are very tough technologies .
and now i can just go and go out with my friends , go do whatever i want .
every problem that 's out there , somebody has the idea for .
i have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed .
but kids , you can see these signs in them .
this one person offered me three cents and i got him up to three and a half .
but it was obvious to me , right ? buy low , sell high .
and i was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle .
remember , i was being groomed to do this . i was not allowed to have jobs .
but the problem is that people all didn 't want all the golf balls .
i remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff , alberta because i 'd thrown a penny out in the street , and my dad said , " go pick it up . "
shit , you 've missed 25 years .
my kids love this stuff .
college presidents are not the first people who come to mind when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination .
questions such as , " what kind of a world are we making ?
incredibly , this nation , with all its material , intellectual and spiritual resources , seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas .
you are not the first to try to figure this out , just as you are unlikely to be the last .
so the challenge for bennington is to do it .
you have a mind . and you have other people .
and ... wikipedia is fixed , finally .
they first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources .
and the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing .
in the good old days when this republican ran that company , their greatest work was work that built on the past , right .
now , i think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about openness .
now , interestingly , they still sold ads for that music , if you played the silent video .
the value of freedom . it 's a value of community .
and eventually these bigshot executives whip out their blackberries and they say they have to make really important phone calls , and they head for the exits .
and he 'd get them comfortable with that .
he 's worked for ge , and he 's had a fantastic career .
but doug 's results that he cared about were much more qualitative .
we see them come up with more interesting , and just more , ideas so they can choose from better ideas .
i think we 're doing it right now , but we 're doing it unconsciously .
and if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit , you 'll see that they 're fundamentally different .
in these rooms , the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well , and when charlie saw this , he got really excited .
and so he suggested a machine , and he called it the memex .
so this is doug engelbart .
but he was completely convinced that his world wide web would take over the world one day .
basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web . you find some interesting content , say a tedtalk , submit it to reddit , and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don 't .
so , greenpeace actually wasn 't that crazy about it , because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win .
and this is kind of how the internet works .
for this reason , i had to leave my family when i was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family .
my people build all the time with clay , but they don 't see any innovation with mud .
i started to build a prototype like that .
they will do it themselves .
when i was a kid , i was going to school , i was coming back every holiday to gando .
all right . very significant mark .
joker : whoa.mt : are you ready for your party piece ?
marco tempest : a cyber-magic card trick like no other
and the problem we have in the west at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in western terms , using western ideas .
it divided , and it 's remained divided ever since .
now , this is completely different from the world 's [ other ] most populous countries .
the result , by the way , is that the chinese have a very different view of the state .
if you want to know why we unerringly seem to get china wrong -- our predictions about what 's going to happen to china are incorrect -- this is the reason .
there was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago -- copenhagen , climate change conference .
so this is a solution to a situation where china 's going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
a button , two guitar picks and lots of hot glue .
in fact , i went to nashville .
[ chinese ] " big sister wong , " washburn , wong , same difference .
" oh , all right . "
then when the photo left , the frame was still there .
i mean , at that time , trust me , they were only referring to the israeli and palestinian conflict .
okay , for example , that 's palestine .
so we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos .
the day after , i came back and they were already scratched .
so how can we know about the project ?
you might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008 .
thank you .
and that has always been a central part of the work .
in some ways , art can change the world .
thank you .
it allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways .
and so from a branding perspective , they got a lot right .
so people have created this business .
and honestly , it 's full of surprises .
so this is an example .
lisa gansky : the future of business is the " mesh "
what happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .
it 's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall .
and , you know , i got a lot of popularity .
but , to cut a long story short , i quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist .
salman rushdie was pissed-off i think because i altered the map of new york , if you notice .
forget it , they will confuse you even if you know how to draw .
i started doing fashion .
i must have been 19 and a half then , and it was love at first sight .
and i said that the best way to celebrate is to marry netra .
the collectors , the friends , the press , everyone said , " nice , but thank you . "
how can a family get dysfunctional ?
i was in australia , and belinda had cancer , and i was told she 's not going to live very long .
sw : yeah .
little splat at the end there . einstein , did that hurt ?
e : yar .
sw : good job !
e : stinker .
my parents found it necessary for peace of mind .
and i would like to share my art .
the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
in freestyle , easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll , and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water .
i couldn 't read any of it -- hieroglyphics , it could have been -- because it was kanji , chinese characters adapted into the japanese language .
having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar , by translating these sentences into past , present , future , will show you subject , object , verb , placement of indirect , direct objects , gender and so forth .
everyone burst into laughter . i was humiliated .
this is the instructor that alicia and i chose for the male lead .
apply them to very big dreams .
and the design we came up with had the following characteristics .
this is one from yorkshire where , in fact , my nephew , i hope , will be able to attend it .
it 's gorgeous , with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards .
and then he turns to the kid , and he says , " but you 've got to wear this armor . you can 't go as you are . "
and a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it , and they put a projectile , either a rock or a lead ball , inside the pouch , and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go , and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target .
so here he is , this shepherd , experienced in the use of a devastating weapon , up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short-range combat .
the first one was in 1960 in the indiana medical journal , and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for goliath 's height .
what they didn 't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness .
so , unfortunately or not surprisingly , most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens .
i gave a talk , and a family friend who happened to be the dean of georgetown medical school was at the talk , and came up to me afterwards saying , they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people .
probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you .
and he shrugged it off , i think he either thought i was just complaining a lot , or it was the typical m.d. " nothing can be wrong with my children . "
and so if you think about what that means , it means a lot more than just building a cool website .
it 's a very unusual and chaotic thing .
and it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions .
if you engage in that type of behavior , you 'll be asked to leave the community .
the type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people .
somebody says , " i 've found it on imdb . keep , keep , keep . "
i was describing this in berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline said , " i am the queen of england . "
it strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased .
so , this is the short story of that research .
so , before i start telling you about the brain , i want to read for you what i think is the most powerful love poem on earth .
we found activity in some cells called the a10 cells , cells that actually make dopamine , a natural stimulant , and spray it to many brain regions .
that brain system -- the reward system for wanting , for motivation , for craving , for focus -- becomes more active when you can 't get what you want .
and indeed , it has all of the characteristics of addiction .
our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague , art aron -- putting people who are reporting that they are still in love , in a long-term relationship , into the functional mri .
so , i will close with this . these are my older people .
why bows ?
the most effective bow for me would be like this .
no , better yet , a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind .
they 're born without spots , and they get spots with age , and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases , so that 's fun to track their behavior .
for example , males will stimulate a female during a courtship chase .
now , these are three spectragrams .
and that 's the scarf whistle , which is also associated with a visual symbol .
so i 'm reaching over . she 's got the scarf on her right side .
we hope so and we think so .
it 's a " feel the fear and do it anyway " kind of thing .
there is yves rossy .
i don 't have feathers .
yr : that 's really the goal , because if you put [ in ] steering , then you reinvent the airplane .
four little engines , 22 kilos thrust each , turbines working with kerosene .
so i was at my minimum altitude in that vector -- fast -- so i pulled that .
it 's well said . it 's well said .
i want to share it , to do formation flights .
the first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as 1899 : radioactivity .
which is why the scientific revolution had to have a wider context .
how ?
it 's like all knowledge . it 's conjectural , guesswork , tested by observation , not derived from it .
that accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth .
but the more important one is explanationless theories .
how do you do this ? how do you solve this problem ?
the technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down .
for the performance , the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house , and the residents , who were the performers , they came out of their houses , and they performed these autobiographical dances on their lawns , on their driveways .
rimini protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city at that moment in terms of race and gender and class , through a careful process that begins three months before , and then those 100 people share stories about themselves and their lives , and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment .
i think what 's so brilliant about the festivals , the new festivals , is that they are really fully capturing the complexity and the excitement of the way we all live today .
second doctor : and good , just take it nice and slow , jake .
it 's a spirit bear , or a kermode bear .
you glaze over with it .
these ringed seals , these are the " fatsicles " of the arctic .
and so i 'm just so happy that the dive is over .
even though that spirit bear moment was powerful , i don 't think i 'll ever have another experience like i did with these leopard seals .
so after five days of crossing the drake passage -- isn 't that beautiful .
i put my snorkel in my mouth , and i rolled over the side of the zodiac into the water .
and then so she realized i couldn 't catch live ones , so she brought me dead penguins .
and i 'm so passionate about it .
now that you 're done looking at those , close them down , because every phone has something in common .
but ironically , you can attend to something without being aware of it .
that 's nice to meet you , sir .
one time a guy had a hole in his pocket , and that was rather traumatizing for me .
you were focused on your hand . that 's why you were distracted .
so -- -- that 's rather strange . they have shots for that .
thank you .
and we worked together first with building and growing ushahidi .
now , this is the reality of kenya , where we live now , and other parts of africa .
the software sensibility at ushahidi is still at play when we wondered how can we use the cloud to be more intelligent so that you can analyze the different networks , and whenever you switch on the backup , you pick on the fastest network , so we 'll have multi-sim capability so that you can put multiple sims , and if one network is faster , that 's the one you hop on , and if the up time on that is not very good , then you hop onto the next one .
but it was also the signal that capped the use , or overuse , of energy-consuming devices .
so in early prototypes i built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system , and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated , and currently have this installation at the materials & amp ; applications gallery in silver lake , close by , and it 's there until august , if you want to see it .
they go to see michelangelo 's " david , " and when they finally come face to face with the statue , they both freeze dead in their tracks .
so , right now , please raise your hand -- down in the simulcast rooms , too , let 's let everybody see who 's here -- please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center .
the worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth .
and this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don 't have tribes , we go ahead and make them , because it 's fun .
the blue line shows you people 's responses on the average of all the harm questions .
well , if you are a liberal , you say , " hey , that 's great ! "
on the first round , people give about half of the money that they can .
the answer , i think , is that they used every tool in the toolbox .
think about yin and yang .
but as we learned from samantha power , in her story about sergio vieira de mello , you can 't just go charging in , saying , " you 're wrong , and i 'm right . "
so when we have to send someone , we send the military -- because they 're there , they 're available and , heck , they 're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support .
now there 's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons , some of which are obviously available now , some of which they 're developing .
they generally seem to think , " well , why would we care what 's happened with the police ?
so it wasn 't that queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on .
and the russian special military police , special forces , spetsnaz , came in and actually stormed the theater .
i confess , this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this .
i kid you not . that 's exactly what it said .
we use words like " grasp " metaphorically to also think about understanding things .
dd : this is something i call " swinging in the rain . "
you 're really a driver or a passenger -- to use a volkswagen phrase .
so i like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this , plus " psycho . "
now the other thing that i think is taking off , another reason making is taking off today , is there 's some great new tools out there .
they 're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think -- the military is doing drones -- well , there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes , or vehicles -- something that you could program to fly on its own , without a stick or anything , to figure out what path it 's going .
it 's glamorous movie stars , like marlene dietrich .
you had " a " glamour .
glamour doesn 't have to be people .
so as i say , in religious art , you know , god is not glamorous .
of course , here you don 't feel the cold , or the heat -- you just see the possibilities .
this is the most glamorous picture , i think , ever .
and certainly , no , it doesn 't look a thing like my office .
national socialism is all about glamour .
virginia postrel : on glamour
i began to see my body like a thing , a thing that could move fast , like a thing that could accomplish other things , many things , all at once .
well my stomach -- it was my stomach i hated .
cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection .
and my friend was preparing this big bowl , and i said , " what is it ? "
what i learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves .
like philip roth , who said , " and yet , what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people ?
and this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults .
rs : that one is joshua 's . that 's right .
so that 's why he 's taking the other sandwich .
but of course , as you 're probably aware , even in adulthood , people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds , how often they do it and how accurately .
and what i 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they 're making that judgment .
so what i 've told you today is that people come , actually , especially well equipped to think about other people 's thoughts .
and so , i think of what i 'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial , but studying the jury .
so i did a spot on cnn the other day where i actually spent more time in makeup than i did talking on air .
and what should have been the most relaxing , the most intimate , the most tender moment of the day , when a dad sits down to read to his son , became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills , a clash between my speed and his slowness .
you either use it , or lose it .
and millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine , which tend to tap into sort of slower , gentler , more holistic forms of healing .
and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout , pleading with me to write to their parents , to help them slow down , to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill .
" slow " is a dirty word in our culture .
i can actually hear it now , because i see my time is ticking off .
so , what i 'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to kahn 's heart , which is : how do we discover what is really particular about a project ?
and finally the building -- this is the model .
he 's demanding to meet the architect . could you come down and meet him in tel aviv ? "
they said , " let 's rebuild the museum . "
and what i felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote kundera -- that it had to do with whiteness , it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism .
okay , i have no idea what we 're going to play .
if you played an e.
and i know that i speak for all of us when i tell you that we don 't take it for granted .
thank you .
do you see me simply smothered in cloth ?
they went through a lot to get here .
i need to explain a little bit about monsoons .
so , they 're very important .
and i feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the maldives .
so , it stays under the soil .
you 'd think they 're coming from india . it 's the closest place .
i wanted to know about their seasonality , what time of year , this is when they first arrive , but how long are they around for ? does that give any clues ?
what are millions of dragonflies doing , flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom ?
what 's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here .
so , in four generations , one , two , three , four and then back .
so , as any sensible bird would do , he moves south . they move south . the whole population moves south .
flying at night over the indian ocean 2,424 meters .
here 's some images of that .
you know , at the very root of that , see , caspers , see how you throw it ?
and indeed i did . it was the very first thing i filmed , which was awesome .
so that 's how that works to me , the creative process , the process itself of street skating .
very similar communities , very similar .
and look , i understand that i am on the very edge of preachy , right here . i 'm not here to do that .
and the man 's name is carl norden .
and he makes this complicated thing .
and whenever the norden bombsight is taken onto a plane , it 's escorted there by a series of armed guards .
not a lot .
the mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the scud missile launchers .
but do you know what the crucial thing is ?
jackson browne plays a song he started writing last april aboard mission blue voyage , the sylvia earle-inspired trip to brainstorm ways to save the ocean . " if i could be anywhere , " he sings , " anywhere right now , i would be here . " & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
in " the descent of man , " he wrote , " in each great region of the world , the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region .
you 're looking at a great example here .
because what we 're really asking is a genealogical problem , or a genealogical question .
imagine the longest book you can think of , " war and peace . "
was it millions of years ago , which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world ?
now , africa is the most tropical continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and capricorn -- and there aren 't a lot of glaciers here , except on the high mountains here in east africa .
the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species , at particular times of the year .
and they got really excited about it . they liked the film , but they said , " you know , we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins , where we all came from , using the tools of dna to map the migrations around the world .
you can go onto our website , nationalgeographic.com / genographic .
an egg is a beautiful , sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things , such as chickens .
you have to survey the whole history of the universe .

i 'm talking , of course , about living organisms .
how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable ?
terrible news for the dinosaurs , but great news for our mammalian ancestors , who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs .
and exploiting that energy , human populations multiplied .
i thank you for your attention .
what if you lose your iphone ?
and we 're going to look at their saving behavior .
we have to understand why people are not saving , and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions , and then see how powerful it might be .
we 're going to look at two similar countries , germany and austria .
very powerful .
if people have to check a lot of boxes to join a 401 plan , they 're going to keep procrastinating and not join .
we invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise .

she was discovering what mortality actually means , and if she is at the depths of mortality , what really happens .
my lady , it is my husband 's child .

now , where does this upper city and lower city come ?
in a poet 's mind , it 's a conflict of words , in the universe 's mind , between day and night .
now , what i 'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people .
everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise .
there 's no more of it .
they 're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do -- scientists , again , agree -- because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today -- on global average , about [ 2.9 ] .
better than lamb produced in new zealand , frozen and shipped to the u.k. ?
these are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view .
we can get our arms around a hundred companies .
if they don 't have commodities , they don 't have a business .
mars is also on a similar journey .
the issue isn 't what to think , it 's how to think .
but , as observed , after most injuries in humans , there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur .
it took many years , but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state .
this is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis .
the truth is that we don 't know enough yet .
and although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant , with me standing here as the first lady of the united states of america , and you , just getting through school , i want you to know that we have very much in common .
they taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family .

there 's a piece by a composer , an american composer called john cage .
i don 't know . as a simple example , we could run a test here .
so unusual , in fact , that it was said that it 's not clear the internet could work .
and they can lather , rinse , repeat . and before you know it , you have a general sense of where everything is .
and some of them are mid-level employees at internet service providers around the world .
but now , wikipedia doesn 't just spontaneously work .
the film , without his permission or even knowledge at first , found its way onto the internet .
so this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture .
that leads to example number three : hitchhiking .
we have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity .
this chart shows you the performance of countries .
and i 'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students .
so you can see two countries spent their money very differently , and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education .
people have taken up the challenge , done something about it .
and you know what 's interesting ? you won 't believe it , but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school .
high-performing systems are very clear what good performance is .
but its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing .
i mean , even here , yesterday i was walking across the street , and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago , right across the street from here .
we had -- quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network .
that you see , the horizontal axis is where you place your country .
poor people apparently don 't have the power to buy .
but that 's why i noticed grameen bank , which is a bank for poor people , and had 1,100 branches , 12,000 employees , 2.3 million borrowers .
you can see it 's pretty much covered .
" the poor are uneducated and cannot do much . "
i used to be in the upper quarter of all courses i attended .
and we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858 .
and you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was united states and united kingdom .
what happens in the after independence ?
if i would split china , look here , shanghai has already catched up .
and when you see the two giant cats here , pushing forward , you see that in between them and ahead of them , is the whole emerging economies of the world , which thomas friedman so correctly called the " flat world . "
they seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know .
and that vision that i got as a young student , 1972 , that indians can be much better than swedes , is just about to happen .
so for now , let 's turn to the evidence for dark matter .
but that cannot account for the mass either .
now , take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe , ok , a three-dimensional space .
and again , this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing .
and it 's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space .
there are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe , and they have very different effects .
it is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the large hadron collider .
so it started when jonny was little , and he first started the banjo , he would play on his back with his eyes closed , and we 'd say it looked like he was sleeping .
and in fact in india alone , 62 percent of all injections given are unsafe .
if someone then tries to reuse it , it locks and breaks afterwards .
so we think , first and foremost , aids is a policy issue .
and one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active .
there 's another risk , and they respond less to this existing risk .
we have no way to figure out what happened over time .
so this is another way to see this .
more exports means more aids . and that effect is really big .
and if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was , then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead .
this is what happens every year .
and i told him , " you know , cody , the wasps actually made that . "
and he thought to himself , " they go from one density of medium , the air , into another density of medium , water , without a splash . look at this picture .
and it goes down the sides and goes into the critter 's mouth .
and it 's in every cell .
in fact , sulfur-reducing bacteria , as part of their synthesis , they will emit , as a byproduct , nanoparticles into the water .
at biomimicry guild , which is my consulting company , we work with hok architects .
and we 'll begin to be able to do as cody does , and actually be in touch with these incredible models , these elders that have been here far , far longer than we have .
like a wide-eyed kid , i 'd say , " why is that ? "
let me begin with my parents .
you either go up , or you come down . "
so this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men .
terrorists , rapists , burglars , gangsters -- some of them i 'd sent to jail as a police officer outside .
books came from donated schoolbooks .
this is a concept which i introduced to listen to complaints , listen to grievances .
the reason it works is because humans , at least non-visually-impaired humans , have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters , whereas computer programs simply can 't do it as well yet .
but then i started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
so what we 're doing now is we 're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we 're getting people to read them for us while they 're typing a captcha on the internet .
so we get this .
so the question that motivates my research is the following : if you look at humanity 's large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically -- like for example , building the pyramids of egypt or the panama canal or putting a man on the moon -- there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
so i would like to translate all of the web , or at least most of the web , into every major language .
so we need people to translate the whole web .
so it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
but perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they 're just beginners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
since people are creating value while they 're learning , they don 't have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
but what 's really happening is that we 've got the power of a free and open internet , and on top of that we 're putting a platform for participation , and the peers are now in partnership with the company , creating shared value on shared values , and each strengthening the other , and doing what the other can 't do .
etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they 're selling it in a marketplace .
and all the owners are adding their cars . it 's really exciting .
type of thing that 's happening here , because individuals , if you 're a company , what happens is you might have 10 people who are in charge of innovation , or 100 people who are in charge of innovation .
well , as with many other domains in life , i think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question .
since we know people want to be happy , maybe when our minds wander , they 're going to someplace happier than the place that they 're leaving . it would make a lot of sense .
in contrast , there 's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind-wandering a short time later .
there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background , and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole .
i mean , nor had ghana , even though we had been trying very hard .
and my heart sank , because i thought , here we are again .
the defeated candidate gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle .
and i realized , the roots of the way i sort of thought was just the only natural way to think about things .
he said -- he called what he 'd done as making -- they didn 't call it a vacuum pump at the time .
charles ii was kind of saying , you know , you should keep that -- let 's make a place where you can do this stuff where people don 't get so -- you know , we don 't want the -- we don 't want to get the people mad at me again . and so -- because when they started talking about religion and science and stuff like that , that 's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble .
like if you do an experiment on stage , and nobody can see it , they can just hear it , they would probably think you were freaky .
and this is just 350 years .
i may not care about the fact that it 's prohibited from heating this solution .
and then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff works .
but you always work from , from like , facts that you have made available to you by doing experiments : things that you could do on a stage .
and those people don 't think -- they don 't -- they don 't always tell you the truth , you know .
excuse me . those papers were published by nasa , and some scientists at columbia , and viliki and a whole bunch of people , princeton .
it 's not by a small one . they just -- they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth -- there 's obviously some mechanisms going on that nobody knew about , because the heat 's coming in and it isn 't getting warmer .
the mta will confiscate your camera . "
it got abandoned when the new croton aqueducts opened in 1890 .
this is underneath my alma mater , columbia university .
the remains of over six million people are housed in there , some over 1,300 years old .
but whenever i get a chance i still work on my series .
ok . now , children get their ideas not from teachers , as teachers often think , but actually from common sense , from experience of the world around them , from all the things that go on between them and their peers , and their carers , and their parents , and all of that . experience .
and that 's no different from imperial college in london , by the way , it 's not some sort of anti-american thing going on .
so , here 's copernicus ' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan .
so , as " monty python " would have it , this is a bit lord privy seal to say so , but this is -- children are not empty vessels .
jonathan drori : what we think we know
and in fact , the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is , in fact , a single cell -- a bacteria .
is life that improbable ? "
you have regulation ; information is transcribed ; catalysts are made ; stuff is happening .
so there are two options : intelligent design , direct and indirect -- so god , or my friend .
i need some information , and i need a container .
if we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete , they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete .
and what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff ?
lc : i think it 's 100 percent .
i bring you to the webpage , childmortality.org , where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries -- it 's done by u.n. specialists .
and when the experts in the u.n.
had i been in the ministry of health in kenya , i may have joined these two points .
and look here when i take you into my bubble graphs .
and then , you see , these were famine years .
and isn 't it a success story .
it got down there -- china comes into the western box here .
and we have to realize that we are all going to into this , down to here .
do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day , the so-called bottom of the pyramid ?
but i was about to leave the school , because my poor mother couldn 't afford schooling .
and at a point in time , he got so engrossed in the whole challenge , that he himself became a member of the team .
you can 't cross that envelope , which is 100,000 rupees , 2,000 dollars .
and i titled this more from less for more and more people as gandhian engineering .
( text : ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this .
let us just take an example .
he is giving us not just for psoriasis , for cancer and a whole range of things , changing the whole paradigm .
and i would also add , it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people , the whole world working for it .
lakshmi pratury : thank you , dr. mashelkar .
and the property of parallel lines is that they never meet .
a lot of kids these days like to play games , but now they want to make them , and it 's difficult , because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program .
i 'd like to finish up by saying what i 'd like to do in the future .
this is between 50 and 100 megawatts .
and these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees celsius , which means the higher the temperature you go to , thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies .
so the core of this reactor , since it 's not under pressure and it doesn 't have this chemical reactivity , means that there 's no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor .
so i 'm really excited .
so , we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy .
they say , we dutch , we like real , natural , authentic experiences .
that has -- the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years .
and of course , if you are both true to yourself , and are what you say you are , then you 're real real !
so , it 's a fake real .
that 's why you have companies like starbucks , right , that doesn 't advertise at all .
so , the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm , but also with very much the feeling realm .
since i 'm always liking to solve problems , i gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction , and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth .
for me , it 's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment , and i wanted to express that .
and i thought , what about the gesture of opening the fan , and how simply could i state something .
and when i had this thought , i was imagining that i would make -- i would have a whole machine theater evening , where i would -- you would have an audience , the curtain would open , and you 'd be entertained by machines on stage .
so perfectly organized a structure , it was hard not to attribute divinity to it .
and like this magnificent origami , cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks , as it 's just folding on itself .
i have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies , etc .
what i see is this one . "
my colleagues in infra-red astronomy call minus 200 kelvin is cool for them .
they actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien . it comes from a different galaxy .
and we need nine centimeters per second to detect an earth-like planet .
and then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here .
if you suddenly observe technetium in a sun-like star , you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere , because in a natural way it is impossible to do this .
and she said , " well , i saw you speak , and i 'm going to call you a researcher , i think , but i 'm afraid if i call you a researcher , no one will come , because they 'll think you 're boring and irrelevant . "
and so to think that i had found my way , to found a career that takes me -- really , one of the big sayings in social work is , " lean into the discomfort of the work . "
the things i can tell you about it : it 's universal ; we all have it .
so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness , where i saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
they thought this was fundamental .
and she said , " what 's the struggle ? "
no .
and then we are miserable , and we are looking for purpose and meaning , and then we feel vulnerable , so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin .
and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say , " look at her , she 's perfect .
after going to sleep at 12 : 45 a.m.
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
gary wolf : the quantified self
so , the first set of pathologies , they end up in the stick man on his icon , but the rest of them are really what 's important here .
here is an m.s. patient .
and i want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years .
i want my brother 's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs , and all of the things that interact among those , the side effects , to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it , so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model i don 't even know what a medical record is .
you don 't want to be on the red line , you want to be on the blue line .
so , we did . we took all the patients like humberto , that 's the apple background , we stole that because we didn 't have time to build our own . this is a real app by the way .
you 're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly , but slightly worse . you don 't want to be a lithium patient this time .
it only works about 12 months .
that same word , " normal , " had two different , almost opposite meanings .
one of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently .
the power plant of tomorrow is no power plant .
i 'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists , no kinder than many of the people in the world , but they have a magic look at the world .
but this is different .
these are just a few examples .
and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
and we already see signs of organization going on here .
they 're mostly financial institutions in the u.s. and the u.k.
james glattfelder studies complexity : how an interconnected system -- say , a swarm of birds -- is more than the sum of its parts . and complexity theory , it turns out , can reveal a lot about how the economy works . glattfelder shares a groundbreaking study of how control flows through the global economy , and how concentration of power in the hands of a shockingly small number leaves us all vulnerable .
we need a few simple ingredients .
last year at ted long beach , we built an installation that builds installations .
one of those is in extreme environments .
now i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground .
what we found is -- if i got this data back studying you here in the room , i would be thrilled , because there 's very clearly a trend that 's going on there , and that means that i can get published , which is all that really matters .
and very quickly , my brain starts to think that 's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world .
seriously , what does a harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about ? "
and if i 'm more successful , then i 'll be happier .
and at the end of that , their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world , not for the negative , but for the positive first .
it 's such a great way to -- i mean , they should make java books like this , and we 've have no problem learning a program .
so , when i got to mit , you know , as most of you who are creatives , your parents all told you not to be creative , right ?
you know , he wrote in one of his books : " a yale student once said , ' i came here to learn how to design , not how to use a computer . ' design schools take heed . "
so , i went off with this , and began to look for things even more .
this computer appears to be fast - she 's working pretty hard , and people are running around , and we think , wow , this is happening at a fast rate .
and you 'd feel so much better , you know .
so , i was wondering , like , what is this thing in front of me , this computer thing ?
the world is just so tasty .
and i went after it with passion .
so i 'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys , and it 's a serious problem with boys .
in fact , what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook , because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic .
another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys .
that means that 93 percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women .
so she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through this curriculum -- and girls .
do they make sense ?
so i 've got to do gaming , or i 've got to do sports . "
it was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees .
we may not realize it in ordinary life , but the intensity of the higgs field is critical for the structure of matter .
why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition ?
gian giudice : why our universe might exist on a knife-edge
and what i learned was , although at the time , like everyone else , i thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn 't do what we wanted them to do , what i realize now , probably only just in the last few weeks looking back , is the sheep weren 't stupid at all .
so what we do is we take conventional printing presses , we make conductive inks , and run those through a press , and basically just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive .
okay .
but it 's not about the technology .
this is a piece called blend , and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art .
what is it about flying cars ?
and at 110 lbs . , that 's very important for solving the other side of the equation -- driving .
radio : what did you think of that ?
and the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas .
here is my naive advertising man 's suggestion .
the prussian peasantry said , " we can 't even get the dogs to eat these damn things .
as an advertising man , i have to admire that .
it 's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies .
fish and chips in newspaper , the cornish pasty , the pie , the sandwich .
now , i 've got an example here from canada .
just try both of them .
when i was 14 years old , i had low self-esteem .
as a result of these efforts , and the help of many others , it happened .
well , i say yes , and if there is , i give the prize to darwin .
sb : no , not without .
look around you -- here will do , in this room .
oh , well , your earrings , i don 't suppose you invented the idea of earrings .
but i took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco-camp in the jungle in assam .
a new replicator was let loose , and it could never be -- right from the start -- it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature , could just copy the useful , beautiful , true things , and not copy the other things .
we 're at this extraordinary point where we 're nearly there , that there are machines like that .
the fraction of those which get a first replicator .
do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body 's energy output for two percent of your body weight ?
well , there are kind of two ways of pulling through .
susan blackmore studies memes : ideas that replicate themselves from brain to brain like a virus . she makes a bold new argument : humanity has spawned a new kind of meme , the teme , which spreads itself via technology -- and invents ways to keep itself alive
behind that door is the national judicial archives .
to make sure these buildings are safe , it 's not going to take policy -- it 's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques .
why don 't we take it a little longer -- maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity ? "
all of these would have been great things to do , and my nurses had no idea .
and you weigh these options out -- you do the simple cost-benefit analysis , and you decide whether it 's worthwhile to commit the crime or not .
it wasn 't that the more religious people -- the people who remembered more of the commandments -- cheated less , and the less religious people -- the people who couldn 't remember almost any commandments -- cheated more .
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ?
it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they 're wearing .
you call them stock , or stock options , derivatives , mortgage-backed securities .
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions .
but what it does show is that it 's sort of gaining ground , it 's gaining respectability .
so you think about loyalty .
they said , obviously tried to dissociate themselves from drugs , but said , " it reminds me of one thing and that 's the value of the brand has stayed consistent . "
and you think , is it much of a leap ?
so today i 'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric ivory tower activity that we find at our universities , but that broad study across species , tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health .
but before it 's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid , it has to become difficult to bend .
so he sat me down , and he warned me .
so i went ahead , collected wall tissue , prepared it so it was erect , sectioned it , put it on slides and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look , fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety .
we 've got limits on our time .
donnell leahy : thank you . i 'm kind of new to the ted experience and i 'm glad to be here , but i 'm just trying to put it all together , trying to figure all you people out , and i 've been here for a short while , and i 'm starting to understand a little bit better .
that 's it .
let 's get her going .
i like it .
and yet , just like salman , they were lifelong , tenacious self-learners , and our home was stacked with thousands of books , records and artwork .
and then something fascinating happened .
i 'm sick of it .
so , in addition to learning some useful geometry , the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated science strategies , like reduction , which is the art of transforming a complex problem into a simple one , or generalization , which is at the heart of any scientific discipline , or the fact that some properties are invariant under some transformations .
can you imagine your world without it ?
as with the arab spring , during the recent elections in the congo , voters were able to send text messages of local polling stations to the headquarters in the capital , kinshasa , and in the wake of the result , the diaspora has joined with the carter center , the catholic church and other observers to draw attention to the undemocratic result .
sending and receiving letters took months , if you were lucky . often they never arrived .
and it 's not just caterers , it 's hoteliers , it 's retailers , it 's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses .
but is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market ?
in the early days of this modern markets technology , the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power , their back office processes , their relationships , their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity .
in terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses , this was an unqualified success .
and there would be no constraints on alternative markets .
plenty of people need jobs with very flexible hours -- but it 's difficult for those people to connect with the employers who need them . wingham rowan is working on that . he explains how the same technology that powers modern financial markets can help employers book workers for slivers of time .
so i quit my job and decided that that 's the subject that i wanted to tackle .
if you look 50 years into the future , the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three , with some wind , with some other things , but these are going to be the base load energy drivers .
in the middle of stars , you 're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon , to make oxygen , all the things that you 're made of are made in the middle of stars .
now , why the hell would we bother to do this ?
we hold it with a magnetic field .
and i 'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is .
but i 'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women , revealing some surprises along the way .
so while economic development made a few people rich , it left many more worse off .
and this hope , this optimism , endured a year of turbulent transition .
so the question becomes , what drives men 's support for women 's rights ?
it 's a 100 percent open rate even if she doesn 't respond to you when you ask her when she 's coming home for dinner .
so think about it , a text hotline ; it 's pretty powerful .
you could say to a principal , " you 're having a problem every thursday at three o 'clock .
and in part , that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great .
at mach 20 , we can fly from new york to long beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds .
in fact , the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards .
the result , a four-by-four-inch artificial nano-gecko adhesive .
tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months , and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever .
sometimes we just forget .
it mattered to me .
rd : well i don 't think we ultimately know what it will be , right .
it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn 't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time .
in the last six months , more than 300 skyscrapers in the uae have been put on hold or canceled .
and that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
and i can 't see myself going into a state prison in new jersey and making such a proposition , but this being israel , the warden somehow made it happen .
at the beginning , it was a disaster .
when i started this program four years ago , i had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs .
it 's very cold , and you 're standing in one of these rainy days , and it 's drizzling and cold and chilly , and you 're standing in , let 's say , yokneam .
and by appreciating complexity , they become more tolerant , and tolerance leads to hope .
so this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up .
my self became defined by otherness , which meant that , in that social world , i didn 't really exist .
in other words , race has no basis in biological or scientific fact .
all my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel -- that feeling of oneness .
we 've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other -- billions of each other .
this is a hospital building .
i think we all kind of stand and watch .
so it felt this has a social dimension .
and so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn 't do a cheesy advert for britain .
so the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us , and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box , very simple box element , and make it a building that could move in the wind .
children : one , two , three , go .
so there were 66,000 of these .
this is a recent study by the neurobiologist paul thompson and his colleagues in which they -- using mri -- measured the distribution of gray matter -- that is , the outer layer of the cortex -- in a large sample of pairs of people .
and so when thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence , " we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , " he did not mean " we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are clones . "
it 's not violence and war , it 's not race , it 's not gender , it 's not marxism , it 's not nazism .
students are staying away in droves , universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities .
but it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors .
so let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices .
and i said , " well , what exactly is the process ? "
and he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
he says , " ok . "
i do .
the other word , peripeteia , that 's the moment in the great tragedies , you know -- euripides and sophocles -- the moment where oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he 's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . ok .
because , dude , you know , four years . "
and he 'd laugh at you .
i scamper down , i go into the wheelhouse and i say , with some level of incredulity , " captain , osha . "
that 's what plumbers look like , right ?
and to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that i got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
so i was leafing through it , wondering if i had any mental disorders , and it turns out i 've got 12 .
and i said to brian , " what did tony do ? "
and i said , " so is it true that you faked your way in here ? "
i subscribe to new scientist , and recently it had an article about how the u.s. army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives .
and i said , " well , what , he didn 't want to hang out with the other patients ? "
so i changed tack .
and i said , " well , some psychologists might say that this makes you ... " and he said , " what ? "

that 's the way these things work .

you won 't be surprised to hear that if i take this circular magnet , in which the magnetic field is the same all around , the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet .
imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable .
so , starting with steel : how do you make steel ?
i dragged out this stuff , and it wasn 't iron .
and it was looking good for a while , but i left it outside , because you had to leave it outside to dry , and unfortunately i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .
but i considered it a partial success , to be honest .
the exponential growth of computing started decades before gordon moore was even born .
and i 'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data .
but we are learning more and more about the human brain .
and so that 's what we 've done .
no one realized that this was a very bad idea .
you don 't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water , to catch a boat to the hospital .
what became very clear was that , within a few days , the outpouring of information was immense , and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before .
you know , as chris mentioned , i wrote a book called " the wisdom of crowds . "
but there 's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side , in fact -- and that is that the more tightly linked we 've become to each other , the harder it is for each of us to remain independent .
that 's the thing we have to fear -- is that we 're just going to keep marching around and around until we die .
that 's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . "
it also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on , so the more they put themselves under load , the more it attaches .
and yet , we know more about the surface of the moon and about mars than we do about this habitat , despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food , a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies .
the census actually tried to look back in time , using every source of information they could get their hands on .
and i want to start with a bit on technology , because , of course , this is a ted conference and you want to hear something on technology .
because gps doesn 't work under water . that 's why we need these tools .
now there are a group of scientists living in texas , working in the gulf of mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the gulf of mexico .
this particular shrimp , we 've dubbed it the jurassic shrimp , it 's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago -- at least it was , until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of australia .
and i 'm just going to summarize just a few of them very quickly for you .
we actually don 't know .
oceanographer paul snelgrove shares the results of a ten-year project with one goal : to take a census of all the life in the oceans . he shares amazing photos of some of the surprising finds of the census of marine life .
they 're perfect .
i 've heard what i consider an extraordinary thing that i 've only heard a little bit in the two previous teds , and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding , an intermixing , of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks -- global responsibility , in fact , appealing to enlightened self-interest , but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest .
so , when we think of hope now , we have to think of looking in other directions than we have been looking .
and here 's what he says , roughly translated : a man -- generic man -- a man , to be greatly good , must imagine clearly .
i suspect he never really said this , because we don 't know what hippocrates really said , but we do know for sure that one of the great greek physicians said the following , and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to hippocrates , and the book is called " precepts . "
there can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn 't affect the way you 're going to move later in life .
now of course there are other moves , but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution .
so one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is , for example , sensory feedback is extremely noisy .
am i looking at a cat or a fox ?
so it 's the optimal way of combining information .
i get you tapping on it , and i get me shaking it , but from my senses ' point of view , that is combined together into one source of information .
and as we go from naught to 0.1 second , it becomes more ticklish .
and the game is very simple .
and i can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed .
so what i can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if i choose that way .
so you think that people thinking about the brain , and consciousness generally , could get real insight by saying , where does movement play in this game ?
this is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet .
today mars is very very dry .
so , there is a lot of water below the surface .
and that 's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites .
this is what ares looks like as it flies over mars .
the airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time .
it 's a large effort . it 's all at nasa langley research center .
wow , you guys are great .
i 'm kind of into this stuff , and i 'm going to stop being embarrassed . "
i was afraid a car was going to come smash it as i was taking a picture for you guys .
we went to brazil . we went to china and to india , to bentonville , arkansas , to washington , d.c. and to sacramento .
so , let me tell you this : when wal-mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions , that 's going to be a very big deal . but i 'm afraid it 's not enough .
i 've got a behind-the-scenes story for you about that green tech network i described .
they now have 29,000 ethanol pumps -- this versus 700 in the u.s. , and a paltry two in california -- and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel .
don 't let me skip over that . better biofuels are a really big deal .
not enough to stabilize the climate .
do it like wal-mart , get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself .
and actually , about a year or so ago , there was this promulgation of the idea of google flu trends , with respect to the flu , where by looking at people 's searching behavior today , we could know where the flu -- what the status of the epidemic was today , what 's the prevalence of the epidemic today .
or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers , or by their neighbors .
but shifted to the left is what 's occurring in the central individuals .
the epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left , over here .
and this type of a visualization can show that epidemics like this take root and affect central individuals first , before they affect others .
this is a map of eight million phone users in a european country .
or , finally , it can be more fully active -- as i know subsequent speakers will also talk about today -- where people might globally participate in wikis , or photographing , or monitoring elections , and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena .
together , the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower .
even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house , selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits .
a gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed and all the garbage is used as props to display all their new home accessories .
in most of these places , the government is completely absent , leaving inhabitants with no choice but to reappropriate found materials , and while these communities are highly disadvantaged , they do present examples of brilliant forms of ingenuity , and prove that indeed we have the ability to adapt to all manner of circumstances .
the librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear .
they take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen .
here chris took the object out of its hand , and baxter didn 't go and try to put it down ; it went back and realized it had to get another one .
mildred 's a factory worker in connecticut .
and turned up the other way , the people who are retirement age goes up very , very fast , as the baby boomers get to retirement age .
let me show you how it works .
what you 're looking at in here is a 3d viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of [ the ] cloud of points in real time , cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions .
in order to sustain our work into the future , we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them , whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites , and at the same time , it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future .
i 'd like to also thank personally the efforts of david mitchell , who is the director of conservation at historic scotland .
and she said -- she was so honest -- she said , " it 's a great question .
but it has been amazingly successful in one regard , in that it has become , it has congealed into this endangered people 's movement that was missing in the 20th century .
i think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly .
in addition to being brazilian , he was described to me before i met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between james bond on the one hand and bobby kennedy on the other .
talk about evil prevailing . i mean , here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in cambodia .
one note on his death , which is so devastating , is that despite predicating the war on iraq on a link between saddam hussein and terrorism in 9 / 11 , believe it or not , the bush administration or the invaders did no planning , no pre-war planning , to respond to terrorism .
i will never use it . i will try to make it such , but i will never use that word again .
we have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps .
but what i 'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on earth -- or one out of every seven -- woke up and didn 't even know how to fill this cup .
but it never struck me as it did that moment , because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby , and she had no milk to nurse .
and we can see brain volumes up to 40 percent less in these children .
we did this with food technologists in india and pakistan -- really about three of them .
we know this .
we 're seeing that now in the horn of africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year .
and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .
no more are we going to accept this . "
you know , i know very well , as a cancer doctor , i can 't treat advanced cancer .
it 's basically symptoms .
if you could start to move that , to identify what you 're up against , you 're going to do things a hell of a lot better .
we were pushed together , and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other .
it 's a system of systems .
so , you can 't tell me it 's working by the same mechanism in all three size .
and so what this is , is we 're taking a cross-section of her body here , and you can see in the middle there is her heart , and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her , untreated , in a matter of weeks .
so , it 's a fundamental problem .
and certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward , instead of just having encounter and encounter , without fundamental learning .
most people find that very soothing , and , interestingly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human .
at the simplest , you move away from unpleasant sound and towards pleasant sounds .
they are all important . and every brand needs to have guidelines at the center .
thank you for lending me your ears today .
but if i 'm going to continue doing these adventures , there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there .
young people in northern canada , kids in an elementary school , dragging sleds across the school-yard , pretending they were richard , ray and kevin . amazing .
and i hope jill tarter 's wish to engage earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe .
i gave a talk not so long ago at the world bank and i showed this amazing image of earth and i said , " there it is ! the world bank ! "
since then , i 've had the great pleasure of working with the googlers , with doer marine , with national geographic , with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world , ones that we could enlist , to put the ocean in google earth .
millions of tons of discarded fishing nets , gear that continues to kill .
imagine the ocean without fish .
there are still places in the sea as pristine as i knew as a child .
legendary ocean researcher sylvia earle shares astonishing images of the ocean -- and shocking stats about its rapid decline -- as she makes her prize wish : that we will join her in protecting the vital blue heart of the planet .
and it turns out that the insects flap their wings in a very clever way , at a very high angle of attack that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing , a little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex , and it 's that vortex that actually enables the wings to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air .
and the basic punchline of my talk is , i 'd like to turn that over on its head .
they have to engage in courtship .
but let 's think about this . how can you make a small number of neurons do a lot ?
you can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display .
so there 's a possibility that you have computational compartments that allow the different parts of the neuron to do different things at the same time .
and what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our perceptual bubble . it keeps it alive .
the mammals needed it because they had to cope with parenthood , social interactions , complex cognitive functions .
but you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns , the note is going to be off .
you may have many different types of trees , but every pine tree is different . and in the brain it 's the same .
and we 've got the mathematics to describe this process .
and then when we zoomed into this , it 's like a veritable universe .
but all the time i was out there doing these strange kayak voyages in odd , beautiful parts of this planet , i always thought in the back of my mind about project orion , and how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships .
nasa had no interest ; they tried to kill the project .
the size of that mass , for us , is really large technology in a way we 're never going to go back to .
so that 's the end . all i can say in closing is , we heard yesterday that one of the 10 bad things that could happen to us is an asteroid with our name on it .
until somebody said , " look , if you 're serious about this , you first have to write a book about your research . you have to publish something , and then you 'll get the opportunity to write something else .
but the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes .
vision is one of the best things we do .
by the way , the netherlands is an interesting story .
now it 's also very hard to intuit these results . think about it for yourself .
all these medications , nothing seems to be working .
i 'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making .
and they passed me from one person to another to another , until eventually i got to a person who was in charge of the website .
so i decided to do this experiment with people .
in fact in medical terms , that 's our view .
and one of the issues is capacity .
x-rays , useful when you go to hospitals .
the one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs , florescent lights , with this new technology of led , led light bulbs .
and that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream .
but , you can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off .
so the data goes in that direction , not there anymore .
and in the future , you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs , you may have 14 billion li-fis deployed worldwide -- for a cleaner , a greener , and even a brighter future .
it doesn 't matter whether you 're a yeast ; it doesn 't matter whether you 're a mouse ; doesn 't matter whether you 're a fly ; we all have dna .
so , let 's talk about what that means .
that 's a tiny amount of material , but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species .
so , you know , we now can learn the history of organisms .
they have discovered pathways that create flavors , although it 's very important to understand that those compounds that it 's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome , in our tongue , for us to understand and interpret those flavors .
if you take a closer look at a root system , you will find there are many , many , many diverse microbial colonies .
they 're here . they 're in the universe .
dogs have interests .
so , this whole dominance issue -- number one , what we get in dog training is this mickey-mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system .
go on , something should happen now .
at the moment , he 's in the park , and you are competing with smells , and other dogs , and squirrels .
this is a life-or-death thing .
she never raised her voice .
and the seminal moment was , i was getting on a plane in dallas , and in row two was a father , i presume , and a young boy about five , kicking the back of the chair .
and it then starts , and we get into this thing , and our personal feedback -- there 's two things about it .
how you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy ?
so what did you do ? how did you realize that ?
wk : four bulbs and two radios .
william kamkwamba : how i built a windmill
and so , i don 't know if you 've ever had this , but when i close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep , i can 't stop thinking about my own eyes .
it 's a rare condition .
here are the numbers one to 12 as i see them -- every number with its own shape and character .
let 's go back to the questions i posed you a moment ago .
why do , statistically , a majority of people say that a word is sad , in this case , heavy in other cases ?
global famine was inevitable .
they 're both technologies . in the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
and i think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
so the gains from trade are only going to grow .
you know , i think it 's probably millions .
even in england , we don 't leave reproduction to the queen .
there 's no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
it 's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
what 's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they 're cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
and as you get a little bit closer , it starts looking like lots of pipes , like maybe a chemical plant , or a refinery , or maybe a hellish freeway interchange .
i want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction .
well , actually , i only had one vicodin that i scanned lots and lots of times .
because my belief is , if we can feel these issues , if we can feel these things more deeply , then they 'll matter to us more than they do now .
and so we looked into this a little more carefully , and i 'm going to show you data now .
i talked about that -- you know , that situation where you go into the clinic and you don 't get diagnosed ?
we don 't know what the sequence is ; just pull them out of the field .
it 's pretty clean . if you 're healthy , you 're pretty healthy .
and the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns , because we 're never going to get samples of every virus -- it would be virtually impossible . but we can get virtual patterns , and compare them to our observed result -- which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something .
and on day six , they basically threw in the towel .
i 'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that 's unpublished -- it 's going to come out tomorrow -- and it 's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door .
we take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue and use material to actually locate the virus , and we find cells here with viral particles in them .
you see , the battery is the key enabling device here .
so let 's abandon the paradigm of let 's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we 'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product .
i made the battery all liquid -- liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte .
no , i hire a student and mentor him , teach him how to think about the problem , to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose .
it 's going to be 36 inches in diameter .
it 's not a joke yet ; those aren 't the jokes .
so a few years ago , my friend eric and i decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the sierras .
did you find the gold ?
i get interested in different kinds of subjects , i dive in , i research them , and then i try to figure out how to craft a toy around that , so that other people can kind of experience the same sense of discovery as i did as i was learning that subject .
when they were able to make stuff in the game they had a tremendous amount of empathy in connection to it . even if it wasn 't as pretty as what other people would make it -- as a professional artist would make for games -- it really stuck with them and they really cared about what would happen to it .
but really the goal here was , within about a minute , i wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create .
eventually they would go out into space , and start colonizing and exploring the universe .
we have very simple little weather systems you see here , very simple geology . for instance , i could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers .
so in fact , we 're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can kind of explore here . now , as we move into the future , we 're drawing a lot from things like science fiction .
but we also have stars and things as well .
so i want you to pay attention to what you 're doing right now .
i became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . as soon they come in , you see it .
they actually feel that they 're going to win even at games of chance .
when you 're touching your neck , you 're really protecting yourself .
it 's you talking to yourself . what do you do before you go into a job interview ? you do this .
i don 't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
like , i have become this . i am actually doing this . ' " so that 's what i did . five years in grad school , a few years , you know , i 'm at northwestern , i moved to harvard , i 'm at harvard , i 'm not really thinking about it anymore , but for a long time i had been thinking , " not supposed to be here . not supposed to be here . "
leave that situation feeling like , oh , i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am .
and the answer is : nothing . there 's nothing in it for the ant .
they 're infectious .
the idea of replicating ideas ; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain .
not silicon .
after all , the meme for shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite .
they 're like a mild cold .
there has to be , between me and the orchestra , an unshakable bond of trust , born out of mutual respect , through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in .
if you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
south africans just make music really freely .
now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme , which is ted .
one more time , with feeling , ladies and gentlemen .
i 'm 22 , and i 'm a left-handed pianist .
charles hazlewood : trusting the ensemble
we were called the " bad news bears , " and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in kigali , which was not hard because there were no snacks before us .
that 's who we talk about when we think about " the poor . "
something i truly believe .
we 're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of africa : people .
jacqueline novogratz : invest in africa 's own solutions
i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers .
and if tempers are still too high , then they send someone off to visit some relatives as a cooling-off period .
and then when he paused , and everyone looked at me for a response , from a balcony perspective , i was able to thank him for his remarks and say , " i appreciate your criticism of my country , and i take it as a sign that we 're among friends and can speak candidly to one another .
stories are the key .
what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance ?
and then a few years ago , a group of us , about 25 of us from about 10 different countries , decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham , going from his initial birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey , northern mesopotamia .
the media love it ; they really adore it .
let me just show you one thing .
so let me just leave you with three things .
a man called yami lester , an aboriginal man , was running a health service .
now i hope most of you are thinking , " what ? that sounds simple . "
you can 't hear as well for the rest of your life .
the teams do a great job , and that 's their work .
well , first thing we do , we get showers working .
all these small health gains and small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference .
yami lama , he 's a young boy .
so y 'all heard that , right ? just to make sure , right ?
and what i 've realized is that political persuasion doesn 't begin with ideas or facts or data .
i 'm not perfect , but what i am is optimistic , because i don 't just get hate mail .
the crazy teacher -- that 's me on the left , i dress up pretty , thank you , my wife , i love you for getting a good suit -- my passionate borough president and a guy named george irwin from green living technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology .
and what do you know ? we made 21st century money , and that was groundbreaking . wow !
wow ! people noticed . and notice they did .
a year ago today , i was invited to the new york academy of medicine .
and that 's a true " sí se puede " moment .
or more importantly , to local shelters , where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day .
my green [ unclear ] 25,000 pounds of vegetables , i 'm growing organic citizens , engaged kids .
i urge you to do something .
then , approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms .
and it 's not hard to see that -- the baseline is the first picture on the upper left .
any one of you now is an expert on st elevation . can you see it there ?
and the person who 's there , the medical practitioner , calls you -- this is also a cell phone -- and says , " mr. smith , you 're in deep doo-doo ; you have a problem .
what does that mean ?
the third and last invention began with an idea .
i 'm a tech ; i 'm into medical gadgetry , which is mostly high-tech stuff like mr. bono talked about .
and that 's how i 'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money .
however , if a video is there that everything was explained to you , and you have it all in the video file , it 'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency , because it won 't be nearly as good a case .
if it works in africa then it will work anywhere .
and we have a small team who is working on this .
after he died , i realized that no one writes to me anymore .
lakshmi pratury remembers the lost art of letter-writing and shares a series of notes her father wrote to her before he died . her short but heartfelt talk may inspire you to set pen to paper , too .
so , that 's what i 'd like to talk about and really , how do we get from where we are now to where we need to go ?
what about copying , reusing , right ?
how much would it cost in a bookstore ?
it gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student , so that every student can have a book or a course that 's customized to their learning style , their context , their language and the things that excite them .
we can 't let this napster thing happen here .
this is a little bit of a problem , so we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control , and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in .
and so that isn 't very hard .
and they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries , more schools , whatever .
we will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it , and then the others can follow .
when you open it up , it 's going to go " bing ; " it 'll be on ; it 'll use it ; it 'll be just like it was in 1985 , when you bought an apple macintosh 512 .
this isn 't a design , ok ?
everybody thinks they know about education , a lot of culture is built into it as well .
an uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present .
well , traditional definition is " an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments . "
you have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life .
and when i was writing my thesis on cell phones , i realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets .
i 'm really worried that , especially kids today , they 're not going to be dealing with this down-time , that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture , and that everything comes to them , and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it .
and i 'm going to talk about hiv today , about the deaths , about the stigma .
so in the united states , since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s , there 's been an 80-percent decline in the number of hiv-infected children .
this is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa -- mothers coming , pregnant and with their babies .
have a seat . you 're safe here .
and so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts .
and if we can change enough communities , we can change national attitudes .
i am proof that there is hope .
and then rework the level of the health care systems , building stronger health care systems .
thank you .
so i 'll just give you an example from my lab .
we tell them , okay , we 're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there 's no director . instead you 've got to ignore objects with the dark gray background .
and this region , the regions within the limbic system , have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults , and at the very same time , the prefrontal cortex , which you can see in blue in the slide here , which stops us taking excessive risks , is still very much in development in adolescents .
so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand , and a few years later , he was diagnosed with cancer .
this was right about the time that i was offered a position here at berkeley , and when i got here , i looked up hubert dreyfus , who 's a world-renowned professor of philosophy , and i talked with him about this , and he said , " this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy . it goes back to the skeptics , and up through descartes .
she knew when to trust her instincts , and so that project taught me another lesson about life , which is that , when in doubt , improvise .
then what we do is , we increase the velocity a little bit .
i 'm a man who 's trying to live from his heart , and so just before i get going , i wanted to tell you as a south african that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago .
ubuntu is at play right now .
now on the day that solly saved my life , he was already my hero .
the meat is torn up .
her name was elvis .
what elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu , and i believe that in the cathedral of the wild , we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us .
" in the cathedral of the wild , we get to see the best parts of ourselves reflected back to us . " boyd varty , a wildlife activist , shares stories of animals , humans and their interrelatedness , or " ubuntu " -- defined as , " i am , because of you . " and he dedicates the talk to south african leader nelson mandela , the human embodiment of that same great-hearted , generous spirit .
you know , i never really believed in legacy . what am i going to leave behind ? i 'm an artist .
and i rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory , you know ? and if technology is not a metaphor for memory , what is it ?
and what a bang it started my career with ! you know , when we think of time in this way , we can curate not only the future but also the past .
it really teaches us who we are , and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world , but it 's really my creativity that 's taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am .
the food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals , and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s .
i want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices , by buying our food directly from local farmers , or our neighbors who we know in real life .
and sylvia earle and i were on an expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in japan .
so where are the phoenix islands ?
but we got up there , and i had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go , " okay , where are we going to dive ?
and they have about 110,000 people they control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean , and that 's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet .
just get whatever anybody wants . "
the oak foundation and national geographic have been big funders of this as well .
there was no fishing , there was no pollution , there was no coastal development , and the reef is on a full-bore recovery .
greg stone : saving the ocean one island at a time
and if any of us have used these , we know that they 're not perfect , but they 're decent .
but despite this challenge , i 'm personally , i 'm still a huge digital optimist , and i am supremely confident that the digital technologies that we 're developing now are going to take us into a utopian future , not a dystopian future . and to explain why , i want to pose kind of a ridiculously broad question .
but some other people do , and they 've kind of crashed the party and loosened up the dress code of innovation .
about 15 years ago , i went to visit a friend in hong kong .
so you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting the police on the new sony walkman .
and , you know , my studio -- we 've done it all the time .
another new york project .
then : working concentrated , without being frazzled .
then it 's : " always works out . "
the other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments , such as the arctic or deserts , where there are periodic food shortages , and occasionally there just isn 't enough food to keep everyone alive .
for example , there 's particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in east asia , associated with confucius ' doctrine of filial piety , which means obedience , respect and support for elderly parents .
perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies .
unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
they almost never die of diabetes , heart disease , stroke , and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today .
the 99 references the 99 attributes of allah in the koran , things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about .
they 're writing in big handwriting to take more gold . "
i think that 's there in all cultures , right ?
and she said , " show me . " so i showed this .
what happens is the world erupts in the danish cartoon controversy .
dr. razem : it 's time to go , miklos .
but that 's only half the story .
it 's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself as extreme .
on april 26 , 2010 , president barack obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous cairo speech -- in which he reached out to the muslim world -- the most innovative was that the 99 reach back out to the justice league of america .
americans , incredibly generous people -- over 300 billion a year , donated to charity every year , compared with the amount of foreign aid given by the top 17 industrialized nations at 120 billion .
the millennium bug , terrible disaster .
because for me , it feels like a fertile , creative medium .
and here 's my visual c.v.
and then you have poor old taste , which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator .
who has the biggest budget as a proportion of gdp ?
this kind of diagram is called a balloon race .
it 's kind of living .
so essentially , we had our first carbon-neutral volcano .
everything that you 're smelling in here is made up of atoms that come from what i call the upper east side of the periodic table -- a nice , safe neighborhood .
and the attraction , the forces , between the molecule and the protein cause the motion . this is a shape-based idea .
we have to go a little beyond that . now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it . these molecules , as you saw in the beginning , the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other .
now , this is a spectroscope , ok , on my laboratory bench .
and so that 's a direct path to making new odorants .
and people often ask me , is your theory accepted ?
working with the harvard business school , you 'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment : if you spent 62 dollars for a meal , the longer you take to pay out that loan , you see , over a period of time using the minimum payment it 's 99 dollars and 17 cents .
we see all this complexity .
it is that simple .
so she goes from oxford , she 's sent to the north of england to a mother and baby home , and appointed a social worker .
and i said , " yeah , of course i do . " because you do .
every time i had a visit by a person who i did not know who would feed me grapes , once every three months , i was strip-searched .
we belong to the family called the hominidae .
when we then find something very important , like the bones of a human ancestor , we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly , using dental picks and fine paintbrushes .
and here is a skull of a homo erectus , which i just pulled off the shelf there .
it was truly exciting .
as al gore so clearly has reminded us , we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet .
now , the island of mauritius is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the indian ocean , and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished , all within about 150 years .
you give me a drawing , you give me a prop to replicate , you give me a crane , scaffolding , parts from " star wars " -- especially parts from " star wars " -- i can do this stuff all day long .
again , like i said , my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell , and also making them for myself , obtaining them , appreciating them and diving into them .
what do they do , how do you start something like that ? i really don 't know .
it would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly .
why didn 't i start and make it bigger ?
i 'd broken my neck and my back in six places .
they said to my parents , the neck break was a stable fracture , but the back was completely crushed .
i had no movement in my legs . i had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots .
you 're in a wheelchair . that 's normal .
it was everybody 's pain . and then i knew , just like before , that i had a choice . i could keep fighting this or i could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life .
i said , " hi , i 'm here for a flying lesson . "
didn 't know how on earth i 'd ever pass a medical .
it wasn 't until i let go of the life i thought i should have that i was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me .
i 'm in that world , but i work purely instinctively .
these are the invisible things that you never see in your life .
when i look at these things , they look pretty normal to me .
this is a detail of a chair that i 've designed in magnesium .
it 's called " superliquidity . " it 's my sculptural investigation .
the coring out of the back lets you breathe .
no , it 's true . fuck ' em . fuck ' em . you know , i mean .
it presents the solar panel to the sun , and at night it 's a street lamp .
you wouldn 't want to have a fear of heights coming down it .
this -- sorry -- -- that 's a solar seed . it 's a concept for new architecture .
thank you very much .
so you turn on the camera , turn out the lights .
another thing all these molecules are telling us that , apparently , bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times , maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history , which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival .
these are the eyes of a living anglerfish .
so i 'm holding it , and i 'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder , and when i do , you 'll see bioluminescence coming out .
and scientists have done this on land for years ; we just use a color that the animals can 't see and then a camera that can see that color .
four hours into the deployment , we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time .
because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
you may know that birds don 't understand the concept of glass . they don 't see it , so they fly into the windows and get killed .
i didn 't have the framework .
i 'm going to pass it around .
well , what i concluded from reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation .
thank you .
so , life has changed dramatically since i hear color , because color is almost everywhere , so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery , i can listen to a picasso , for example . so it 's like i 'm going to a concert hall , because i can listen to the paintings .
so you relate people that you wouldn 't relate , and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces .
and the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it 's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe , because ultraviolet is a dangerous color , a color that can actually kill us , so i think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive .
she was wholly unconcerned about the bears , but she was terrified of lawyers .
but the reality is , these crazy cases are relatively rare . they don 't usually win .
well , the healthcare system has been transformed : a culture pervaded with defensiveness , universal distrust of the system of justice , universal practice of defensive medicine .
and how has this system of law worked for government ?
but the challenge here is not one of just amending the law , because the hurdle for success is trust .
those dikes have burst . people wade through law all day long .
as you 're going down , and walking down the sidewalk during the day , you have to think that if there is a dispute , there 's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you 're acting reasonably .
what the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices .
impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees .
practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is .
together they comprise practical wisdom , which aristotle thought was the master virtue .
and the family was united .
for ms. dewey , this isn 't why she became a teacher .
these are people who , being forced to operate in a system that demands rule-following and creates incentives , find away around the rules , find a way to subvert the rules .
no one wanted non-violent offenders -- and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot -- to be thrown into prison .
so the patients are not organ systems , and they 're not diseases ; they 're people , people with lives .
in an intimate talk , barry schwartz dives into the question " how do we do the right thing ? " with help from collaborator kenneth sharpe , he shares stories that illustrate the difference between following the rules and truly choosing wisely .
and basically , we lived for all those years , and some might argue that we still do , in a situation of being on the brink , literally , of an apocalyptic , planetary calamity .
yet , what percentage of americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house ?
and what happened was -- when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era , which started back in 1945 .
that -- you 'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium .
what if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon ?
there 's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the earth many , many times over .
and what happens is -- this is -- i 'm going to show you now some fallout plumes . within 20 minutes , it comes straight down . within 24 hours , lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds , and it 's mostly in this particular direction -- it 's going northeast .
and the farther you are away in distance , the longer it is in time from the initial blast ; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere , the better .
irwin redlener : how to survive a nuclear attack
how have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems , these many issues that we face in society ?
we can 't scale .
how do we tap into this ?
it 's profitable to have an unsafe working environment .
in the very short run , you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there 's fundamentally opposing goals , but in the long run , ultimately , we 're learning in field after field that this is simply not true .
but we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have ngos and government working in partnership with business .
i 'm going to do some cuts .
you don 't want to hear " oops " in real surgery .
it 's a female now .
after this , they were scientists , professionals with a particular scientific method , goals , societies and funding .
for example , ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports .
and for the first time , they gave women a foot in the door of science .
so i have a strange career .
because , yes , if you see something like this , then all right , fine , i 'm going to call it life -- no doubt about it .
and then you might come up with something like this .
so having seen this work , worked a little bit on this , this is where i came in .
and then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation , like this one , which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before , until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved .
well it turns out , we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks .
and there 's actually some instructions that you only use once , if ever .
and then that signature is lost .
the cop says , " are you sure ? hey buddy , are you sure you lost your keys here ? "
we have paper forms for vaccination surveys .
this is what we base our decisions on in global health : little data , old data , no data .
there are millions and millions and millions of programs , millions of clinics that need to track drugs , millions of vaccine programs .
i noticed that every sub-saharan african health worker that i was working with had a hotmail account .
but there are some additional benefits as well .
collecting global health data was an imperfect science : workers tramped through villages to knock on doors and ask questions , wrote the answers on paper forms , then input the data -- and from this gappy information , countries would make huge decisions . data geek joel selanikio talks through the sea change in collecting health data in the past decade -- starting with the palm pilot and hotmail , and now moving into the cloud . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
and when we drop the ballast overboard we climb .
throwing overboard , as ballast , to change our direction .
but we were expected to have doubts ; we 're expected to have fears .
but it will not be possible in the future any more .
why that ? because fuel is not easy to replace .
and this is exactly the symbol of our world .
but much more , to get advices , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it 's possible in the air , of course it 's possible in the ground .
what turns me on about the digital age , what excites me personally , is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing .
they called me , " the girl with the beard . "
the right to live like a human .
africa is a continent in flames .
the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world .
well , much more than we think .
well , now , actually because of you , it is possible to change the physical world .
there are moments in history when civilization redefines itself .
and you , at this conference , are in a unique position .
you see , if this is true , and i believe it is , that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter , this should be a piece of piss .
that 's one billion media hits .
one , by one , by one .
and that is my third and final wish for you at the ted conference .
but whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else , we give it a whole network of analogies too .
silence is sweet .
object metaphors describe price movements as non-living things , as in , " the dow fell like a brick . "
now metaphor is ubiquitous , yet it 's hidden .
so many people are there .
how did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper , especially in such times of conflict ?
it was very hard at first .
and a lot of it is because women are not able , are not free , to show their face to their self .
my father was assassinated .
and certainly , when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we 've created fear and danger , often from lack of knowledge , lack of real understanding , how do you see the way that the western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region , but in particular , in your country ?
six years before that , i was starting my career as an opera singer in europe , when i was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension -- also known as ph .
doctors insert a catheter into your chest , which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds .
but his -- well , the only way i can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline .
i wanted to live .
and in my surgeon 's 20-year career , he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he 's ever performed .
this past summer , when i was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the colorado rockies , i couldn 't help but think of that doctor who told me that i couldn 't sing .
in canada , we 're now looking at one in 10 canadian children with asthma .
and not only do these genetic males mate with other males , they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they 're genetic males .
the baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure .
how do you show that ?
th : one of this things that 's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is that , well , i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said , " turn to the man at your table and tell them , ' when the revolution starts , we 've got your back . ' " the truth is , women , you 've had our back on this issue for a very long time , starting with rachel carson 's " silent spring " to theo colborn 's " our stolen future " to sandra steingraber 's books " living downstream " and " having faith . "
and it 's my feeling and it 's my urging being here to know that , as we women move forward as the communicators of this , but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children , bearing the children , we hold most of the buying power in the household , is that it 's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world .
we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes , here imaged by ted presenter chris jordan , who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail .
i thought i would spend 20 bucks .
now , the market can do a lot for us , but it can 't fix the natural system in the ocean we 've broken .
in recent historic times , about 96 percent of the coast redwood forest was cut down , especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging , clear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s .
steve sillett and marie antoine are the principal explorers of the redwood forest canopy . they 're world-class athletes , and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists .
she 's , by the way , tied in with a rope so she can 't fall .
redwoods grow very slowly in their tops .
and there 's also something that i want to show you .
in the 1950s , a small organism appeared in richmond , virginia , called the hemlock woolly adelgid .
ants are not known to occur in redwood trees , curiously enough , and we wondered whether this ant , this species of ant , was only endemic to that one tree , or possibly to that grove .
so let me show you something .
basit and amjad ; they are still there .
today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
but the thing that they 're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
they will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another -- moving around the world , using the fact that we don 't have the capability to globally police operations like this .
so obviously i googled for it .
and even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
think about all the services we have online .
i 'm not engaged in predicting random number generators .
so , we have to work out who influences problems .
nobody can keep that straight in their head .
how they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information , but once we know where they are we 're worried about where they 're going to be headed in the future .
and down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy , which is what they say is their objective .
ok , so i 'd like you to take a little away from this .
so , if you 're in the audience today , or maybe you 're watching this talk in some other time or place , you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem .
well , most rights owners , instead of blocking , will allow the copy to be published .
it 's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners .
the smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us .
i 'm on a remote island in micronesia .
the wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot .
so in closing i would offer you this : the planet is our canoe , and we are the voyagers .
we can make anything happen . we can -- i agree with what was described a few days ago , about this idea that people work in their self-interest .
we know the rules . you write the code . you follow the -- and you get the results . once you know the game you just , you know , you up the ante , don 't you ?
and -- and -- -- what do all those , including the supreme court , have in common ?
is this the end or the beginning ? is god punishing me or rewarding me , or is this the roll of the dice ?
audience : aye .
but , while we go for certainty differently , if we get total certainty , we get what ? what do you feel if you 're certain ?
if you don 't raise your hand , you 'll have had other shit too , come on .
then next year i did four . i didn 't tell anybody what i was doing .
i was with 2,000 people from 45 countries . we were translating four languages simultaneously for a program that i was conducting for a week . the night before was called " emotional mastering . " i got up , had no plan for the this , and i said -- we had all these fireworks -- i do crazy shit , fun stuff -- and then at the end i stopped -- i had this plan i was going to say but i never do what i 'm going to say . and all of a sudden i said , " when do people really start to live ? when they face death . "
thank you . i hope this was of service .
instead , i 'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories , people all around the world .
and i 'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized . so this is we feel fine .
montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid .
it 's a bit different from the others .
another technique is directly questioning people .
zeus battling chronos for control of mount olympus .
the data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world .
you can see that this is an important story ; there are a lot of things in its orbit . if we open this up , we get different perspectives on this story .
clouds .
or seeing the big , white , puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank .
they can be 200 miles an hour , 300 miles an hour .
these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere .
so keep looking up , marvel at the ephemeral beauty , and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds .
and just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds , and that would correspond to one terabyte of data -- that 's 800,000 books and 16 kilometers of phone books .
so this is where this little dear comes into play .
that 's where those artifacts are coming from .
you can really see the details of the data set .
it 's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms , using standard graphics gpus .
and then i can feel the brain inside , and this will be the slushy like this .
and this is a little bit freaky , because what motts is seeing is actually this .
so this is a cat scan -- computer aided tomography .
anders ynnerman : visualizing the medical data explosion
i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible , to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world .
and , admittedly , it 's in a very shorthand notation .
the gap is very tiny , and i 've blown it up so you can see it .
and we try to convince ourselves -- we really try to convince ourselves they 're wrong .
it just doesn 't exist scientifically .
and we recruited wonderful staff , highly motivated staff .
and where they 've gone . so these are all postgraduate students .
professor : tendai is working very independently .
well , it 's not my ted wish ; it 's our wish , as you 've already gathered .
local scientists must play leading roles and governments must be persuaded to buy in .
what people didn 't realize , and i 'm just beginning to realize right now , is that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim is a big advantage of these computers .
so , this clip is from the pbs series , " the secret life of the brain . "
and when you turn off the gate , there 's no current flowing through the device .
and you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel .
they want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes , what 's new in the image , and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve , to send to the rest of the brain .
so this image here is going to look like these ones , but here i 'll show you that we can reconstruct the image , so , you know , you can almost recognize kareem in that top part there .
thanks kwabena , that was really interesting .
so why is it so important ?
so , i wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is , as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole .
again , a source of energy that 's very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars .
so , this is great , because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume .
this technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that 's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you .
so , we 're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume .
so , what do we see ?
second , we 've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact , and understand , maybe , the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are , and how they work .
and a tough , slouchy kid got up to bat , and he took a swing and really connected .
and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries , as have our preferences for them .
and every musical era had different priorities of these things , different things to pass on , different ' whats ' and ' hows ' .
turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words .
it spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like caruso and bessie smith were on the same footing .
there 's just a role here for so many people -- teachers , parents , performers -- to be explorers together .
so this is of course orville and wilbur wright , and the wright flyer .
and we 're working towards megawatt-scale machines that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity .
i 'm really happy that mr. anderson invited me .
and then , when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form -- solidified , excuse me -- solidified form , you 're supposed to actually polish the piece , polish the details , and then polish the overall performance of the composition .
oh , d and f -- too familiar .
so , let 's explore .
you can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel .
but the desire element is really dialed way up .
we are learning from them .
it packs a huge amount of data , and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it .
why would someone bother ?
for the first time in human history , talented students don 't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers .
who 's the teacher ?
i bet chris has always been an inspiring guy .
because the most favorite tedtalks are , on average , over 50 percent longer than the least favorite ones .
so , now it 's time to put it all together and design the ultimate tedtalk .
okay , so what ? in fact , the so what is , in the brain , changes in neural activity , the things that make your brain work , the things that make your software work in your brain , are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow .
in 1997 , the cult heaven 's gate committed mass suicide predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship hiding in the tail of the then-visible comet hale-bopp waiting to take them to the next level . it was an incredibly tragic event .
so how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe ?
these kinds of probes exploit it . okay ?
the fact is , though , that even when we 're alone , we 're a profoundly social creature . we 're not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people . in fact , our minds depend on other people . they depend on other people , and they 're expressed in other people , so the notion of who you are , you often don 't know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people that are close to you , people that are enemies of you , people that are agnostic to you .
of course we don 't .
it was able -- but only it was able -- to organize health care , education , policing , justice .
choice . now you all shop online , compare online , do everything online , and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education , or health care or policing , and you 're going to see this change massively .
other examples are recycling .
that 's how we improve .
so there 's really only one area where we 're near the top , and that 's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills .
i want to show you what this video component of met looks like in action .
i 'm glad that we 've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works , what doesn 't .
i hope you are too .
[ " am i a biohazard ? " ] it was pretty depressing .
that 's a lot more than conventional science has done .
and the same kind of technology -- it 's called dna barcoding , it 's really cool -- you can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga , if that sushi is really tuna , or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat 's .
let 's call it island networks .
so you tell me why , in our age of science , we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition .
you 're a class b felon , lifetime sex offender .
se : hilma and nick and our man in the kingdom are among the 34 million people living with hiv according to recent estimates .

there 's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world .
half the challenge is to get access , is to be in the right place at the right time .
and his tags popped off in the caribbean and even in brazil .
so it doesn 't really make sense at all .
so where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis ?
so that wasn 't going to work .
so we rushed out to blasket as soon as we heard there were sharks there and managed to find some sharks .
but isn 't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines , such as geneticists , who can gain so much more from that .
my journalism is hinged on three basic principles : naming , shaming and jailing .
my journalism is about hard core evidence .
but you see , when you have the hard core evidence , you are able to affect society .
my kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries , but i can tell you , it works in my part of the continent of africa , because usually , when people talk about corruption , they ask , " where is the evidence ?
if you don 't , you will end up losing your life .
we start forming cliques as soon as we 're old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
i was playing a kid named walter in a movie called " julian po . "
but i was struck by the fact that america , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
and i basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don 't know , is a limitless number of people .
i challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
can you quantify your openness ?
so is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
one , the world is , was , will always be filled with good and evil , because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition .
i became an expert witness for one of the guards , sergeant chip frederick , and in that position , i had access to the dozen investigative reports .
who are the bad apples ? " well , that 's a bad question .

so i want to thank you . thank you . thank you .
this is not a person that is being studied at autopsy .
now the first part , the first problem , is relatively easy -- it 's not easy at all -- but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience .
and in that image there , you see a variety of islands of what i call image-making regions in the brain .
i like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day .
and it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that i believe -- and i could be wrong , but i don 't think i am -- that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings -- primordial feelings , by the way .
and out of that came the instruments of culture -- religions , justice , trade , the arts , science , technology .
my parents were radicals -- who became , well , grown-ups .
now i tell you this -- i tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself , because i think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics , that beauty , that fun do matter .
we don 't want one hero .
you may have guessed by now , i did not light myself on fire .
she was talking about board meetings , she was founding peace organizations , she was coordinating carpools , she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .
i take it from this little dictum , " know thyself . "
and i 'm here today to share a new way that we 're working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before -- humanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours to more fully know the self .
i 'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit , but first i want to take a look at how we got here .
that you could know something about yourself .
it 's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop .
would you get a divorce ?
i wanted to race cars , and i wanted to be a cowgirl , and i wanted to be mowgli from " the jungle book . "

and do you love what you do , caroline ? "
i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with .
and then the minute it came , it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart -- something different .
and together we would trek a thousand kilometers across india .
even though i present confident , i was scared .
it 's really , really tiring .
it 's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box , but it has no control over the circumstances .
we didn 't have a framework .
red traffic lights have a countdown delay .
google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one .
and i think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
he says , if you run a restaurant , there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking the food and the value you create by sweeping the floor .
we can 't tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it .
and sometimes we make real plans .
now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine , and in this environment , it costs lives .
these are stories from 20 , 30 years ago .
about half of all trials , on average , go missing in action , and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings .
we won 't publish any journals , we won 't publish any trials , unless they 've been registered before they began .
this software allows interactive use , so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live .
this is an image from saturday , photographed by the aqua satellite , but through the uniview software .
when we started making these , i started thinking , why can 't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody , people who aren 't fantastic yo-yo mas or princes ?
it 's very powerful for depression , schizophrenia , many , many things .
so , as you can see in this prototype , gigantic piano strings , each string is controlled with a little robotic element -- either little bows that stroke the strings , propellers that tickle the strings , acoustic signals that vibrate the strings . we also have an army of robots on stage .
dan ellsey : hello . my name is dan ellsey . i am 34 years old and i have cerebral palsy .

tod machover of mit 's media lab is devoted to extending musical expression to everyone , from virtuosos to amateurs , and in the most diverse forms , from opera to video games . he and composer dan ellsey shed light on what 's next .
he 's like , " you idiot . you moron .

so ultimately , i just decided i would leave it in an envelope on the subway .
whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click " done " and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one .
you can see his current annual income -- this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today -- is quite high , 91 percent , but his retirement income is quite low .
and what 's good is , unlike in the experiments that hal and myself ran with russ smith , you don 't have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality .
and when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a european language .
rahul is offered a cardiac procedure , but rajiv is sent home .
it 's this injustice that has really driven my mission to try to do a little bit to transform the lives of people affected by mental illness , and a particularly critical action that i focused on is to bridge the gulf between the knowledge we have that can transform lives , the knowledge of effective treatments , and how we actually use that knowledge in the everyday world .
it seems to me that there are five key lessons that i 've shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting .
and their basic inspiration was a stern review of lord stern .
that can 't keep going on , because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful .
because these are important benefits for the poor .
and if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries , the fish nurseries , that provide fish for the poor , that answer is more like $ 11,000 .
so we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for india and its states .
we are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure . "
green carbon , which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions , and blue carbon together comprise 25 percent of our emissions .
and i 'm going to tell you the richard feynman that i knew .
and in fact , we did sometimes do physics together .
and the last time the rich guy invited us , he also invited a couple of philosophers .
they had met the great man ; they had been instructed by the great man ; they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud , and it was something special .
he was a master mechanic , and he taught me how to use tools .
there 's something much deeper than that , but i can 't think of another word for it .
he wrote down a simple thing .
feynman said , " forget all of that .
what 's it like to be pals with a genius ? onstage , physicist leonard susskind spins a few stories about his friendship with the legendary richard feynman , discussing his unconventional approach to problems both serious and ... less so . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;

it 's an important lesson for kids to understand -- that some of these laws get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpreted .
cancer may kill you , but when you look at the numbers , arthritis ruins more lives .
and the tissue 's very expensive .
so that 's our biologic approach right now .
the space age began 50 years ago in october , and that 's exactly what sputnik looked like .
so the printing press , ladies and gentlemen , was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading .
part of the question that i have answered is , is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli : with human achievement , with history , with the things that drive us and make us human -- the passionate discovery , the bones of dinosaurs long gone , the maps of space that we 've experienced , and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination .
and we never think about the hidden connection .
sound , light : i 'm going to draw the analogy .
they tried this back in the ' 60s and were too smart , and so they gave up .
atms that talk to you ; nobody else hears it .
now , the question is , where 's the sound made ?
so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people , and there can be a public beach just off to the side , and they don 't even know it 's turned on .
let me give you , in the last minute , one more quick demo of this guy , for those of you that haven 't heard it .
these days , i call myself a graphic artist .
and here it is with the abstract surrounding .
so i 'm currently working on a book , which plays with both senses of the word , as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur .
i got an almost 100 percent response rate .
each one of them is completely different .
and i actually really feel that it 's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way .
you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot a little push .
péter fankhauser : meet rezero , the dancing ballbot
and so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don 't want to do , it 's very difficult .
here 's the dna sequence , here 's the protein sequence in order to do it . "
and by doing that , it allows the virus to express random protein sequences .
we 're able to do this also with catalysis .
so we have companies and non-profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort .
what is that about ?
and even though the workday is typically eight hours , how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office ?
why do we expect people to work well if they 're being interrupted all day at the office ?
i mean , is this china ? what the hell is going on here ?
the manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together , and it 's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people -- is to say , " hey look , we 're going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting .
so i have some suggestions to remedy the situation .
another thing you can try is switching from active communication and collaboration , which is like face-to-face stuff , tapping people on the shoulder , saying hi to them , having meetings , and replace that with more passive models of communication , using things like email and instant messaging , or collaboration products -- things like that .
and i specialize in human behavioral research , and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways , and to design for that future .
and it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff .
you don 't need to ask permission from anyone , you can just go ahead and do it , right ?
you can 't ask someone to do that on your behalf .
and it 's quite likely that they 'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk .
they reverse-engineer manuals .
when those extra three billion people 's identity is mobile , it isn 't fixed ?
that 's my feeling .
it 's that reeeee-e-e-each out , the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop .
renny gleeson : our antisocial phone tricks
these differences were highly significant .
that didn 't happen to me .
but if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane , i think you need to learn to live , not without regret , but with it .
so top six regrets -- the things we regret most in life : number one by far , education .
we 're not trying to understand how the problem came about .
this is obviously an incredibly painful experience .
that is johnny depp and me and our seven million friends .
some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are .
in the united states , since 2001 we 've had five years of economic growth , five years of productivity growth in the workplace , but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent .

finally came mankind 's most advanced and mysterious tool , the computer .
" the sun times sent me to the cannes film festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the porteram telebubble .
ironic that my legs are fine , and it 's my shoulders that slow up my walk .
i seem , for the time being , to be cancer-free .
so , should we rather ask , " can anything save newspapers ? "
my approach was very egotistic .
but the real hit was in bulgaria .
and everybody can do it .
and they left .
and my lung collapsed , so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well to stop that catastrophic event from happening .
so there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had .
but i did say no to the blue hair .
and the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street .
but the concept held true -- people working with people to rebuild me ; people working with people to re-educate me .
it helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world .
but what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them .
the alhambra somehow asks all of these questions .
now , for galois , there was actually a sixth symmetry .
and there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end .
the combined effect , the triangle ends up somewhere completely different .
and then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge , where i can rotate by 180 degrees .
but here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact .
let 's have the other ones , who sat down during the 20 , up again . okay ?
i 've learned that they 're really the essence of what makes for progress , even when they seem to be terrible .
that 's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence .
the patent had 64 pages of text and 271 figures .
in the second world war , too , the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain .
he was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions , and so he started to develop a system of dry photocopying , which he patented in the late 1930s -- and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in 1960 .
every new invention changes the world -- in ways both intentional and unexpected . historian edward tenner tells stories that illustrate the under-appreciated gap between our ability to innovate and our ability to foresee the consequences .

david pogue : 10 top time-saving tech tips
and one of the things i can do is make it bigger if i want to emphasize it and make it more important .
thank you .
i really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you , tedsters .
and to understand that , you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works .
and so they have to find a way -- and they use algorithms to do this -- to break up that big thing into a million little transactions .
a few hours later , it had gone up to 23.6 million dollars , plus shipping and handling .
and they 're in your house . they 're in your house .
and they operate on milliseconds and microseconds .
we 'll actually part the water to pull money out of the air , because it 's a bright future if you 're an algorithm .
the fact is , you can do it all with one towel .
js : now , there 's now a real fancy invention , it 's the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out .
but that 's just safety .
and you 'd still come out ahead .
but you all are members of communities , and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows .
the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .
and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries , it doesn 't get much investment .
and that 's where we saw the malaria map shrinking .
we all had a wonderful education .
if you 're low-income in the united states , you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree .
and the answer is no .
it 's an unbelievable thing .
they don 't have the test scores , and there 's a whole thing of trying to block the data .
but i -- i 'm optimistic .
i find in so many things that tension between what i can control and what i have to let go happens all the time , whether i 'm creating a new radio show or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons .

the molecule they had developed had three parts .
in this movie , you can see that the tumor is green .
who amongst us hasn 't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold ?
but i went ahead anyway .
i think that it 'll change the way that we do surgery .
quyen nguyen : color-coded surgery
so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ?
now how are we going to do that ?
so this is very powerful .
now we 've shown that a brief activation of these is enough , indeed , to drive learning .
okay , there it goes . right now .
most of us don 't have fungi or algae in our brains , so what is our brain going to do if we put that in ?
so he 's not using vision to do it .
so our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities .
and we also sampled the outdoor air .
and what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside .
and all the people who lived in the neighborhood , who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood , were all out there -- had them all open .
the whole system kind of working on it , and everybody contributing a small little part .

the columbia blows up , suddenly there are a lot of searches on columbia .
hubbard apparently started to reach , but besides that , i think it would be good next year .
and so the question is , " why is this happening ? "
we are inveterate storytellers .
the film that changed my life is a 1951 film by vittorio de sica , " miracle in milan . "
by now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms -- black and white , subtitled , documentary , non-narrative , fantasy -- and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose .
my mother 's mother left europe in a hurry without her husband , but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt .

this is a hospital monitor from los angeles , sent to china .
i guess he didn 't read vitruvius .
you know , most people don 't realize it comes from the latin competere , which means strive together .
we have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing , and we 're releasing this database into the public in six weeks .
they showed up in five days .
we then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure .
it turned out that the capability to collect data , information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we 've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about western intelligence agencies , mostly u.s. intelligence agencies , watching over the rest of the world .
in fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners .
a real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because , you know , bad people might have house alarms , but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result .
inside nsa , the unit is called tao , tailored access operations , and inside gchq , which is the u.k. equivalent , it 's called nac , network analysis centre .
it used to be end-to-end encrypted .
and when the leaks started , the very first thing i tweeted about this was a comment about how , when you 've been using search engines , you 've been potentially leaking all that to u.s. intelligence .
some are blaming him for causing problems for the u.s. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations -- and blaming snowden for causing problems for the u.s. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming al gore for causing global warming .
typically , what you 're looking at is a fixed brain . it 's gray .
but you can also see things underneath there as well .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map .
and from there it 's routine . they understand where to make these assignments .
we 've put all of that together into one thing , and i 'll show you what that synthesis looks like .
and for the first time , we can actually do that .
and so this shows it 's not 99 percent , but it 's roughly 90 percent correspondence at a reasonable cutoff , so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated .
thanks .
africans have already got a lot of aid .
and here 's another question : malaria . malaria kills almost 900,000 people every year , most of them in sub-saharan africa , most of them under five .
but these three questions , i can answer them .
well , if that 's the problem , then that 's much easier .
now , you might say , " well , but it 's not sustainable .
second thing is , how about the use ?
well , if that had been the case , there would have been no industrial revolution .
that doesn 't sound like that much when you think about it .
so this evidence is powerful .
but i want to turn that upside down for a moment , and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say .
it all began with a fantastic phone call .
now , the thing i remember about siwa was the magical view of the sky at night .
so i want to share with you some of these bellwether signals , or signs , and winds of change that are sweeping this continent .
to hear this dialogue that 's just increasing in tenor and velocity , of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come .
but the first eurobond , the raising of international capital offshore , off its own balance sheet , without any sovereign backing -- that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy .
it ties in with small-scale farmers in terms of no pesticides , no fertilizers .
what 's going on in some of the other countries ?
so in conclusion , i want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago .
when people see my images , a lot of times they 'll say , " oh my god . " have you ever wondered what that meant ?
this day , right now , has unique weather , maybe a kind that will never exactly in that form come again .
when i showed it , and i asked , immediately after the screening was over , what they thought of it , what was your memorable shots , they changed them .
it 's what you dream about .
so i 'm going to just let it run , so you kind of absorb this sort of thing , and i 'll describe my sort of reactions when i was looking at it for the very first time .
it was , incidentally , the last time i ever saw daylight .
and he said , " because no one knows you had anything to do with it . "
she could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed , face down , on a hard surface .
kb : no , no , you 're fine , you 're fine , take it off . you 're ok . you 're safe .
kb : what ?
but because your brains are not trained in the art of deception , the solutions you come up with will , 99 percent of the time , be way off the mark .
can you stand over here ? this will just make it a little bit easier .
kb : twice . ok , extend your left arm out in front of you .
close your eyes right now .
only when you want the pressure to be released , make an upward gesture , like this , but only when you want the pressure to be released .
do you want to try it ?
but i want you to take this very seriously .
nicole : mm-hmm .
sj : no one in the audience ?
don 't stack them up , ok .
kb : oh , no , no , no . he asked me could he do the left hand . absolutely not .
kb : thank you .
i always dreamt that , when i had my final breakdown , it would be because i had a deep kafkaesque existentialist revelation , or that maybe cate blanchett would play me and she would win an oscar for it .

so you 've got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane , so , you see what the problem is ? what once made you safe now drives you insane .
i want to know if there was a moral molecule .
i think i can do that .
now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person 's account .
i didn 't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .
in this book , smith argued that we are moral creatures , not because of a top-down reason , but for a bottom-up reason .
" hey , a guy just found it . "
these are not people you want to have a beer with .
i didn 't know a single person .
and they had the reporters and their producers participate .
and they 're happier because they have better relationships of all types .
the victorians were great engineers .
and i used to think , how on earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?
so i said , " how on earth do you know all this ? "
so then people said , well , how far will it go ?
so a little girl who you see just now , she raised her hand , and she says to me in broken tamil and english , she said , " well , apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes disease , we haven 't understood anything else . "
so what are jobs going to be like ?
when you 're standing in a trench all alone , if you could have survived , you 're okay , you 've passed .
sm : so what 's happening here ?
they built the first curriculum , but we 've lost sight of those wondrous questions .

so it 's a very , very thin architecture .
i joined 10 years ago because i wanted female role models , and i was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession , and what that meant for our image in the media .

but this is also about something far more complex : our own unconscious biases and blind spots .
and i 'll leave you with a video clip that i first saw in 2007 when i was a student in london .
in fact , you could be in a bottle with a cap on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any fresh air .
and none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn 't been for saddam hussein .
so that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping .
as you travel now all over the world , which you do frequently , how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls ?

and that 's what magic is to me , so , thank you .
so what i have here is a wireless router .

tamara roukaerts : we 're ready to go .
and if it will be , it 's the right thing to do , and if not , rethink it . "
what will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next 30 years ?

nina jablonski : skin color is an illusion
so the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property , that each part is like the whole , but smaller .
the closer you measure , the longer it is .
and i think that my mathematics , surprisingly enough , has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses , all these branching systems , for which there was no geometry .
it was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man 's mind .
then i was telling my assistant , " i don 't see anything . can you paint it ? "
where are real price increments ?

in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles .
we let the doctors make all the decisions , take the driver 's seat .
road density is six times greater in asia than it is in rural africa .
africa 's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications , but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions , such as market information , grades and standards , and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers .
and this is not just specific to ethiopia , but happens over and over , all over africa .
this innovation is at the heart of the transformation of american agriculture , and the rise of chicago to a global market , agricultural market , superpower from where it was , a small regional town .

sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way .
so , we pushed the piles down through the dune , and we create an initial bacterial surface .
borges said that " nothing is built on stone , everything is built on sand , but we must build as if the sand were stone . "

in what i call the flushed-and-plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in , the most common symptoms associated with those diseases , diarrhea , is now a bit of a joke .
poop 's not particularly adequate .
and you might think it 's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit , but it 's also good economic sense , because they 're saving a million dollars a year .

it cost nothing . it 's going to save that boy 's life .
i started out in chesapeake bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight .
and that 's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide .
it 's not just the fish , though , that are disappearing .

and we 've grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope -- running down resources , cutting down rainforests , spilling oil into the gulf of mexico , changing the climate -- and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades is recession .
so i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics .
and to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades , we 've expanded the money supply , expanded credit and debt , so that people can keep buying stuff .
here 's another one -- completely different one : why is it that we don 't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change , very , very simple things like buying energy-efficient appliances , putting in efficient lights , turning the lights off occasionally , insulating our homes ?
well psychology actually says there is a tension -- a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors .
the difference with ecosia though is that , in ecosia 's case , it draws the revenues in the same way , but it allocates 80 percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the amazon .

my early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn 't expect to be used as canvas , like fried food .
alexa meade takes an innovative approach to art . not for her a life of sketching and stretching canvases . instead , she selects a topic and then paints it--literally . she covers everything in a scene--people , chairs , food , you name it--in a mask of paint that mimics what 's below it . in this eye-opening talk meade shows off photographs of some of the more outlandish results , and shares a new project involving people , paint and milk .
it is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .
i 've talked to engineers . that 's specifically to diffuse our anger , because supposedly we feel good about atms .
but they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing .
so the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing .
we only have two percent of the world 's oil reserves ; 65 percent of them are in the persian gulf .
the other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the gulf of mexico , which was not part of the moratoriums .
and one of the things that we need to do is , not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient , but we also need to fix the economy in general .

now , this is actually becoming such an interesting idea .
and the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins .
well , it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme , that you can take a linear string , which is a convenient thing to copy , and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3d structure .
you then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -- so that 's part of the extra program .
so , a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time , and unless lisa randall changes that , we 'll continue to move in linear time .
and so you want that to tow boats very fast .
the solution , in fact , may be closer to hand than we think , because all of those cities we 're building are opportunities .
and people are embracing this .
buildings are becoming bundles of services .
and if we have another eight billion or seven billion , or six billion , even , people , living on a planet where their cities also steal the future , we 're going to run out of future really fast .
the death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes : criticizing the king , stealing a loaf of bread . slavery , of course , was the preferred labor-saving device , and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment . perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning , in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire , and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat , howling in pain , was burned to death .
hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought , and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first .
i loved that talk . i think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of -- that you were talking about , that peter singer talks about , is also driven by , just by technology , by greater visibility of the other , and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller . i mean , is that also a grain of truth ?
it 's not surprising , because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms .
hiv is a serious problem in the dr congo , and aid agencies have flooded the country with free and cheap condoms . but few people are using them . why ? " reformed marketer " amy lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a traditional model of philanthropy .
and we had one set of countries up there which was the western world .
by the way , i 'm teaching you how to use our website , gapminder world , while i 'm correcting this , because this is a free utility on the net .
and my son , youngest son who studied in beijing , in china , he got a long-term perspective .
this is $ 10 , whether you have a public or a private health service system . this is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children , and this is oecd countries : green , latin america , east europe .
but when i split it , when i split it into country bubbles , the size of the bubbles here is the population .
and they are highly skilled professionals .
1900 , sweden was there .
and they made the social investment . they got away malaria .
and you can see it 's not that easy , that it is war which caused this .
and over the last two years , 2,000 people has been crippled in the southern tip of bandundu region .
i 've got to warn you : the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle , sometimes even elusive .
with the invention of writing , you start getting cities . this is blurry . i kind of like that because it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point . and then you get to , you know , you get empires .
and a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me , most impresses me , and most uplifts me , which is that there is a moral dimension to history ; there is a moral arrow . we have seen moral progress over time .
we overreact because being human , we feel like retaliating , and it gets worse and worse and worse .
now , launching a moral revolution has got to be hard , right ?
and a kind of saving higher moral level , something that kind of literally saves the world .
how the media covers africa in the west , and the consequences of that .
medicines for the poor , food relief for those who are hungry , and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war .
the ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity .
to get legitimacy , governments often need to deliver things like primary education , primary health , roads , build hospitals and clinics .
so , the most enterprising africans end up going to work for government , and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid .
one hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies , all of which have directors and the cars . and the final thing , this is addressed to mr. bono . in his work , he may help us on this .
" not good . "
and i think that 's terrific . i 'm proud of it .
and starting about six years ago , we asked about extremely happy people .
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .
he 's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that 's because len , like most of you , is enormously capable of flow .
the second path is eudaimonian flow .
well , my undergraduates and the people i work with haven 't discovered this , so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun , and to contrast it .
we also know that technology , entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery .
pygmies in the drc , by randy olson .
we got back on shore ; he was fine .
he 's actually taking his own picture , shot with what 's called a camera trap .
but what nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight , " isn 't this an amazing world ? "
back on land , randy olson photographed a makeshift fish market in africa , where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals , the main parts having already been sent to europe .
so you can imagine paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water .
this is her just puffing out , you know , snorting out in disgust .
now , if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit , we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in , and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point .
these are the displacement maps here .
i don 't speak english .
it 's where i really getting passion with what i 'm doing right up to now -- i 'm standing in front of you -- doing botany and wildlife conservation .
so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve .
that is people moving around , that 's even pygmies .
with friends , we had been sitting and watching match football , and having some good music with worldspace radio , when it started , i think .
but i was doing that , negotiating with them .
and when we finished the meeting , i went to return it in the forest .
and also , what one of the speciality we are doing , my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity , and what the impacts of the ituri forest is playing to uptake carbon .
i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have .
what would you guess ?
for two reasons , i think .
and how many would be opposed ? how many would -- so the majority here are opposed , but a sizable minority are in favor .
the two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books .
here 's why .
and here 's my theme : because of the headwinds , if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last 150 years , growth is cut in half .
now what if we could achieve that historic two-percent growth for the next 70 years ?
and that 0.8 is the big challenge .
in america , before the motor vehicle , transportation depended entirely on the urban horse , which dropped , without restraint , 25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine .
the 1980s brought us bill gates , dos , atm machines to replace bank tellers , bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector .
and i 'm going do that also by looking at what i think is part of my creative process , which includes a number of things that happened , actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which i 'm creating something new .
my father was a baptist minister , and he believed in miracles , and that god 's will would take care of that .
and it 's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen .
so their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning , and unfortunately , in the process the fish die .
and you are noticing it more often .
there are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book .
is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things ?
years go by , of course , and the writing , it doesn 't happen instantly , as i 'm trying to convey it to you here at ted .
novelist amy tan digs deep into the creative process , looking for hints of how hers evolved .
and it goes around and around and around , the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago .
now , i had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated tv commercial featuring tom arnold , that would get you to get in your car , drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich .
because it 's new , because it 's fresh .
it was all about going for the center .
but the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car , if they 've got the otaku or they 've heard from someone who does , they go ahead and they pick this .
but you don 't have to be ozzie osborne -- you don 't have to be super-outrageous to do this .
and my big failure ? i came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in sacd format -- this remarkable new format -- and i marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos .
i collected my findings in a book , placed them chronologically , stating the name , the patron , the medium and the date .
so i come with my stencils , and i spray them on the suit , on the tank , and on the whole wall , and this is how it stands today until further notice .
number two : a declining population means scarce labor .
and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater , incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .
this ended up becoming a cover story at national geographic .
and this just drags over the bottom , in this case to catch shrimp .
i also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead , an animal that really hadn 't been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago .
and there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw tyrannosaurus rex running by .
72 percent of the population has such scars , but most don 't shed the gear , things like lobster traps and crab pots .
you know , this is probably how the ocean looked here one or 200 years ago , but nobody was around to tell us .
that changed my life quite dramatically , and as of today , i have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers .
this was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife .
you formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control , whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice .
we lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months .
and this forest is quite different .
and then slowly , the trees start taking over , bringing in produce from the fruits , from the timber , from the fuel wood .
and finally i made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain .
so now we do the monitoring on the inside -- from towers , satellites , ultralights .
willie smits : how to restore a rainforest
strings attached to dancers .
are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it ?
i 'm working in cities for almost 40 years , and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big , or the other mayors say , " we don 't have financial resources , " i would like to say from the experience i had : every city in the world can be improved in less than three years .
so , this system started in ' 74 . we started with 25,000 passengers a day , now it 's 2,200,000 passengers a day .
and you can understand how different it 's going to be , the image of rio with the system -- one-minute frequency .
this is the italian portal , the ukrainian park , the polish park , the japanese square , the german park .
jaime lerner : a song of the city
that 's the tradition of god , the soul and immortality .
watch . i decide consciously to raise my arm , and the damn thing goes up .
and just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious , depending on the behavior of the molecules .
and we have not been able to do that in a robot .
we know that actual human consciousness has something more than that .
that 's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity .
... don 't you feel ?
but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn 't imagine doing anything else .
we don 't teach american history in britain .
ask a room full of teenagers the same thing .
i don 't mean you shouldn 't go to college , but not everybody needs to go and not everybody needs to go now .
about nine years ago , i came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said , " college begins in kindergarten . "
i worked out recently that i was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that eric clapton got his first guitar .
it 's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you 're actually teaching .
i think there 's a belief that it 's just impossible , that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind , that you cannot measure history .
what 's the origin of this ?
use more force ?
and they did it in a total devotion to non-violence .
and if it grows very big it probably happens .
it 's okay to be angry with the thing -- the nuclear weapons in this case -- but it is hopeless to be angry with the people .
but there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from , and that 's a brilliant u.s. lieutenant colonel called chris hughes .
i don 't have to believe in it .
here we are , in a space , the subjective , collective space of the darkness of the body .
this is a place , in a way , that i just would like you to , in a way , look at differently because of this event that has happened in it , a human event , and in general , it just asks us to look again at this world , so different from , in a way , the world that we have been sharing with each other , the technological world , to look again at the elemental world .
and there you can see what a liverpool sea looks like on a typical afternoon .
for me , art is not about objects of high monetary exchange .
they went on to describe me as america 's greenest ceo .
and i reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of t1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
we call this mission zero .
but what if we reframed ehrlich further ?
please meet " tomorrow 's child . "
you know , frankly it 's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology .
both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion , internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models .
today 's dance world is not defined solely by the royal winnipeg ballet or the national ballet of canada , but by liz lerman 's dance exchange -- a multi-generational , professional dance company , whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 , and who work with genomic scientists to embody the dna strand and with nuclear physicists at cern .
what an exciting and inspiring event .
and so for the remaining two years of my high school , i cut all my classes .
and the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is i wanted one and i had the checkbook , so i bought one and put it there .
the cost is incidental but the gesture is huge .
but the concept was that i wanted to take the stigma out of food .
and so you must ask yourself the question : how is it possible in the 21st century that we graduate children from schools who can 't read the diplomas that they have in their hands ?
this is our gallery .
i gave this little slide show at a place called the silicon valley and i did all right .
and then a guy named wynton marsalis showed up .
and i can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on oprah winfrey will sell 10,000 cds .
the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i 'll tell you where i made my big mistake .
as a matter of fact he did know willie brown , and willie brown and herbie and i had dinner four years ago , and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth .
i 'm going with you , man . "
i am banking on you and i 'm banking on guys like herbie and quincy and hackett and richard and very decent people who still believe in something .
here you have a retina .
it 's not like we 're making a little mini-device for each of the different cell types .
but there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution .
i know you think of yourself as human beings , but i think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial .
this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
and what we found -- so this is now supposed to be , again , my bacterial cell -- is that vibrio fischeri has a protein -- that 's the red box -- it 's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule , the red triangle .
what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages .
this is the bacterial esperanto .
what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal , in this case , a mouse , it doesn 't initiate virulence right away .
so , we 've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better .
first , let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality , give you a very short lecture on aristotle of ancient athens , aristotle 's theory of justice , and then have a discussion here to see whether aristotle 's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today .
the greatest benefit to all .
they said , " no .
charlie says -- we 'll get charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply .
is walking the course essential to the game ?
justice scalia 's opinion is questionable for two reasons .
that 's really what marriage is about .
so you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions , but with people from china and india joining in ?
ok . hands up : anyone in the audience who 's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?
but the question is , are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite , namely , leaving aging as it is ?
this pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .
but it isn 't .
that in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp .
i 'm calling it " robust mouse rejuvenation , " not very imaginatively .
so we 're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications .
but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage , side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end , or that might cause pathology .
and we 'll just end with a few things .
ag : that 's right .
then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends , including president obama .
and , although we do work in the financial sector , where excel is king , we believe in emotional capital .
but i 'm more of the revolutionary , and i should be ; i 'm from iceland .
halla tomasdottir managed to take her company audur capital through the eye of the financial storm in iceland by applying 5 traditionally " feminine " values to financial services . at tedwomen , she talks about these values and the importance of balance .
while most cities were reaming out their roads , removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic , they instituted a skinny streets program .
but we 've only started talking about inactivity , and how inactivity born of our landscape , inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk , is driving our weight up .
we 're pretty safe here .
until some economists said , you know , is that the right way to measure co2 ?
you may have heard of it .
well , point number one , each of them represents a unique family of its own .
and just as everybody got excited about it , bang !
and then again . and pretty soon , we had early stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those .
you think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing , sitting in a pool of water .
these are photos of the last surviving thylacine , benjamin , who was in the beaumaris zoo in hobart .
well , george church in his book , " regenesis , " has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented dna .
if the only nuclear dna that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine dna , that 's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil .
the grasslands were sweeping away .
it 's very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spoken . everything has been said .
people are now confident to bring -- if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
the microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there .
the issue is how are we using what has been given back .
and she had such a high fever . we tried everything .
today she 's 41 years old , a mother of three , and she 's a physician saving other lives .
for which many people , even from other parts of the world , are going there to find jobs .
will we make the same mistake that we made before ?
well , why don 't we first say to those helping us out , " don 't be shy about infrastructure .
let 's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership .
and lastly , what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid , government , private sector and the african as an individual ?
and i think that 's a good question .
now i 'm going to review a study that i did , which was jazz in an fmri scanner .
were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising ?
nurse : nothing 's in your pockets , right mike ?
now when i think about improvisation and the language , well what 's next ?
whether or not you like the music is irrelevant .
and at top of that pyramid , it 's calculus .
communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .
it 's also wireless , so it gives you the freedom to move around .
ah , good job !
and moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world , with robots and simple machines , for example -- in this case , flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking " lift " with your mind .
almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures .
and there 's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved .
and if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your nail beds .
how can you tell ?
once upon a time , this was the primary technique , and , in fact , many countries got rid of malaria through ddt .
and then you could decide : " is this an insect i want to kill , or an insect i don 't want to kill ? "
nm : that 's a mosquito wing beat you 're hearing .
the humble potato -- and i 've spent a long time , 25 years , preparing these .
if they 're not working , put a shelf on it , which i did , and that shows all the customers my products .
this is the waste room .
the whole thing is electric , the restaurant and the kitchen .
what i needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people .
i think that there are many problems to come , but with help , i 'm sure i 'm going to find solutions .
on a good day , i 'll have maybe three or four seconds that i really want to choose , but i 'll just have to narrow it down to one , but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway .
i turned 31 last week , which is there .
this is the animaris currens ventosa .
and that stuff , you see , is going to it the other way .
i still have to help them a lot .
so that was the phage phi x 174 , which was chosen for historical reasons .
so in addition to doing the transplant , we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell .
we felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic dna from natural dna .
even with this announcement , as we did in 2003 -- that work was funded by the department of energy , so the work was reviewed at the level of the white house , trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it .
craig venter and team make a historic announcement : they 've created the first fully functioning , reproducing cell controlled by synthetic dna . he explains how they did it and why the achievement marks the beginning of a new era for science .
and then there was the language , the rhythmic cadence of it , reminding me of evenings spent listening to bedouin elders recite hours-long narrative poems entirely from memory .
yet all there is in the original arabic is that one word : houris .
the queen just lays the eggs . there 's no management .
so the queen goes down in there .
so , things happen to an ant colony .
i don 't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes , but instead because when there 's flooding , occasionally the colony has to go down deep .
so when i first set out to work on task allocation , my first question was , " what 's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks ?
the nest maintenance workers become foragers .
so anybody who 's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae .
each ant , then , as it comes back in , is contacting other ants .
i 'm a believer .
and it continues .
yes , it 's going to continue .
so where are we headed from here ?
i think it 's probably 175 billion barrels .
thanks for that .
somebody the other day said i was the second largest natural gas producer in the united states .
do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon ?
tbp : i 'm teasing .
you 'll keep using it . it is the cleanest of all .
when you think about resilience and technology it 's actually much easier .
but they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 1850 they still hear that . and they think it 's not real .
they loaded up their mules and their horses .
and that was , of course , the very common story .
so all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- i 'm going back now to , sort of , the explosive part of the web in 1994 , when it was growing 2,300 percent a year .
i want to point out one thing . this is -- you guys know what this is .
and as i said before , they hadn 't invented the electric outlet either , so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device .
by the way , dsl is a kludge .
i want to warn you about that .
and there , the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor .
none of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion .
basically , a zero-sum game is the kind you 're used to in sports , where there 's a winner and a loser .
you 've probably heard the term " interdependence " applied to the modern world . well , that 's just another term for non-zero-sum .
because , you know , historically , if you 're not being respected , you 're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum , mutually profitable relationship with people .
and it 's going to take real work to change that .
and when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
but he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn 't make sense .
so , i decided over the years , because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture .
and we said , wonderful ! look at this pretty structure .
so , what do we do now ?
we have made a lot of discoveries , we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin .
and unfortunately or fortunately , chemistry won .
we have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism , a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they 've pulled it from the shelves ; a new york times exposé on fake book reviews .
they 're called the butler , the sock puppet and the chinese water army .
and of course , you might suspect that nicodemus jones is r.j. ellory .
how about facebook itself ?
well , what explains all these studies ? what explains the fact that despite our intuitions , mine included , a lot of online communication , technologically-mediated communication , is more honest than face to face ?
let 's turn to now , the networked age .
b is a fake . well done second group . you dominated the first group .
so by all means , go ahead and do that , that 's good .
woman 4 : google " jellyfish . "
this project has lasted now , been just over two years .
i don 't sleep that much , and i 've come to this thing about , like , not sleeping much as being a great virtue , after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment , or something .
and i saw this really smart critic who i love .
so i do it .
that 's the name of the show , they eat out , they -- that 's on my tombstone when i die .
again , i don 't know where inspiration comes from .
and that was a very , very , very big part of my process .
and there 's got to be some way to do that , rosie .
i 'll tell you that i cook a lot also . i love to cook .
chef : you can 't ?
so who would think that it was low-fat ?
now this is not all necessarily good news , because it 's also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much as love .
so as i said , we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it .
and the christmas day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the united states of america .
why is it that extremist organizations , whether of the far-right or of the islamist extremism -- islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of islam over the rest of society -- why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way , whereas those who aspire to democratic culture are falling behind ?
statistically , they are educated , on average , above the education levels of western society .
well , egypt is a good starting point .
and so a plan came up to video the vote .
and the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations .
and the earthquake was reported as it was happening .
and so they started , the citizen journalists started reporting that as well . and there was an incredible picture .
the classic media problem , from the 20th century is , how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network .
by the summer , in the middle of the general campaign , he said , " i 've thought about the issue more . i 've changed my mind .
even though it means changing the way we 've always done it . "
camp one , 2,000 feet higher .
okay . this is camp one .
it becomes very calm , there 's no wind at all .
if you fall to your left , you 're going to fall 8,000 feet into nepal ; if you fall to your right , you 're going to fall 12,000 feet into tibet .
and rob got that message , but his answer was , " we 're both listening . "
they picked the name for their baby .
so , as i was taking care of beck , he related what had been going on up there .
this might be what beck would be experiencing when he realizes he 's in danger .
he 's beginning to focus , he can concentrate now .
these sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags , the message will be carried up to the gods , and that year , beck 's message was answered .
today we talk of people as an asset .
and the fact that we have english is now becoming a huge strategic asset .
and really there are four things here .
and i think now you 're seeing the move towards improving our cities .
the third thing is our higher education .
but if india grows at something like eight percent , income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050 .
i 'm afraid i 'm one of those speakers you hope you 're not going to meet at ted .
basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for .
and you have more choice-driven societies .
now the elites basically have been liberated .
this is probably true .
he said , " listen , this is the best way to keep the mouths of my ministers closed .
now , many of you may have noticed there 's a problem at this point , and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened .
instead of just coming out of the prison with 46 pounds in their pocket , half of them not knowing where they 're spending their first night out of jail , actually , someone meets them in prison , learns about their issues , meets them at the gate , takes them through to somewhere to stay , connects them to benefits , connects them to employment , drug rehabilitation , mental health , whatever 's needed .
so taking peterborough as an example , we add case management across all of the different organizations that we 're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners , and at the same time they learn from the ministry of justice , and we learn , because we pushed for the data , what actually happens , whether they get re-arrested or not .
nellie mckay : " clonie "
" neither do i. it will be an adventure , sir . "
hello , habibi . just don 't move . just stay there please .
never " hi , jack . "
thank you very much , tedx .
tedx .
we started r & amp ; d in 2006 .
you probably had no idea . it 's like driving around the world six times .
one is the focused ultrasound , and the other one is the vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging .
so you can change the intensity , the frequency , the duration , the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush to a hammer .
and this is his handwriting .
and one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the mr is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively .
and john today is fully independent .
he took the treatment , and on the way back , he drove the truck by himself .
well , there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen -- quite lethal , very lethal actually -- pancreas , liver , kidney .
imagine having a surgery with no knives involved . at tedmed , yoav medan shares a technique that uses mri to find trouble spots and focused ultrasound to treat such issues as brain lesions , uterine fibroids and several kinds of cancerous growths .
now , the reason for this , the reason that the fashion industry doesn 't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection .
now , the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry .
they don 't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing .
they develop a persona , a signature style , much like fashion designers .
who owns a look ?
it 's embarrassing . "
he 's smart , he 's smart .
so i started researching , and to my surprise , this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences .
this is a brain coral living in tobago that 's around 2,000 years old .
rachel sussman : 300 ? no , 175 is the oldest living tortoise , so nowhere near 2,000 .
and what looks like two big heaps of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time .
this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours .
videos created with popcorn behave like the web itself : dynamic , full of links , and completely remixable , and finally allowed to break free from the frame .
that means it 's completely remixable . it also means there 's no proprietary software . all you need is a web browser .
and then think about this : why can 't i get a cell phone signal in san francisco ?
they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel , and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed .
the ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially , and it 's scaling for good and it 's scaling for evil .
every time a new technology is being introduced , criminals are there to exploit it .
in the united states , there are 60,000 people who have a pacemaker that connects to the internet .
engineers , by moving around a small number of genetic changes , were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch , so that not thousands of people would die , but tens of millions .
what happens if we were to take the president 's dna , or a king or queen 's , and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that dna and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders ?
after all , public safety is too important to leave to the professionals .
in a short story called " oh yes , " she talks about a white woman in the 1950s who has a daughter who befriends a little african american girl , and she looks at her child with a sense of pride , but she also wonders , what price will she pay ?
and i sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands -- beautiful rhythms -- as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them , wearing these beautiful silk colors .
then they decided that they would do tedx 's .
and the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of islam who fundamentalists don 't believe are fully muslim .
i had the great honor of working with the child psychologist dr. robert coles , who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states .
and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written .
i think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits , we would find his face looking at us .
now , are they made in the right order ?
on that occasion , i found my wife carrying something like this .
even in bangalore you won 't get [ one ] , in india .
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research .
she replied immediately , " i know about napkins , but if i start using napkins , then we have to cut our family milk budget . "
now 110 countries are accessing it . okay ?
but seven years ago , i went to the arctic for the first time .
some people think that swimming is a very solo sport , you just dive into the sea and off you go .
and they were swollen so much , i couldn 't even close them .
and at worst , i didn 't even want to think about it .
everything just looks so gray around here , and looks so cold .
and people ask me , " lewis , what can we do about climate change ? "
and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .
this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems .
what 's different is how the molecules are put together .
it 's because , well , thousands of years ago , people invented ideas -- they had ideas , innovations , technology -- and the stone age ended , not because we ran out of stones .
and i thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk .
and he had never appeared in public since that point .
i didn 't know who she was , and she said , " did you get george abbott to talk ? "
there 's an extraordinary woman named clare boothe luce .
most people think that i was an actress . i was never an actress . "
i interviewed steve martin . it wasn 't all that long ago .
he said , " but i understand that . " he said , " i understand that . "
she agreed .
here 's the thing , everybody loves a beautiful baby .
we killed thousands of post-it notes .
those decisions are made by the ministry of health or by foreign donors , and it just kind of shows up .
so here 's an example . this is an overhead phototherapy device that 's designed for american hospitals .
so similarly , when we think about our partner mtts , they 've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses .
in other words , you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it .
are we designing for the world that 's coming , whether we 're ready or not ?
to the contrary , we knew that this project would destroy the environment : it would destroy riparian forests , which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups , the samburu and the turkana in this area .
so this is what i mean with a failing governance structure , because even the powerful government , which we have in germany , comparatively , was not able to say , " we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad . "
we had a broader , geographically much wider , constituency we were trying to defend .
the ku klux klan is an ngo .
the thing is , i think we should give ourselves a break .
but i think what 's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing , and that is the look on her face , the conflicted look on her face .
so , she 's in the house .
they would have spent the time alone , all that time .
again and again , back to the painting , looking for the answer , looking for the story to fill in that gap .
you put all those together , and you 've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back .
he glanced at me . " that collar looks to be strangling you . "
it has created thousands , if not tens of thousands of jobs .
aimee corrigan , a very talented and young photographer , and robert caputo , a friend and a mentor , who is a veteran of national geographic , and told me , " you know , franco , in 25 years of covering africa , i don 't know if i have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun . "
i believe in the power of audiovisuals .
smw : you can now walk the street and see a role model .
that 's why i use enough masking tape .
incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars .
it 's not an added sequence , just some voices from nollywood .
there is a glut of film , the quality has to be raised , they need to go to the next level , but i 'm optimistic .
if the day is sunny , i think , " oh , the gods have had a good design day . "
did i ever say they were art ? i was talking about interaction design . excuse me .
we were talking about dancing ponies , but i was really jealous of the walker arts center for putting up this festival , because it 's very , very wonderful .
i mean , that interface is beautiful .
at moma , interestingly , there 's a lot of violence depicted in the art part of the collection , but when i came to moma 19 years ago , and as an italian , i said , " you know what , we need a beretta . "
but that 's what would enable us to preserve the video games for a really long time , and that 's what museums do .
the controllers are , of course , part of the experience , so you cannot do away with it .
when the museum of modern art 's senior curator of architecture and design announced the acquisition of 14 video games in 2012 , " all hell broke loose . " in this far-ranging , entertaining , and deeply insightful talk , paola antonelli explains why she 's delighted to challenge preconceived ideas about art and galleries , and describes her burning wish to help establish a broader understanding of design .
and so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown , in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into .
and i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and morandi-like things that i used to do .
and it 's one of the nicest pieces i 've ever made , i think .
the highlight of the performance was at the end .
and he pushed that .
so it 's out in the middle of nowhere , and you approach it .
and so then i put this big billboard behind it .
it 's in the west valley .
we used it at loyola on the chapel , and it didn 't work .
this is a piece of property in brentwood .
a guest bedroom , which has this dome with marble on it .
these are the early studies , but they have to sell furniture to normal people , so if i did the building and it was too fancy , then people might say , " well , the furniture looks ok in his thing , but no , it ain 't going to look good in my normal building . "
and it faces into a park .
and another restaurant .
and the plan of this -- it 's a concert hall .
but you get the sense of the hall in section .
i didn 't expect lou danziger to be here , but this is a building i did for him in 1964 , i think .
i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes , so i 'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes , which is charcoal .
as it turns out , there actually wasn 't any waste paper in this village .
kids and women are especially affected by it , because they 're the ones who are around the cooking fires .
and he 's found that worldwide , you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel . that 's remarkable , but up until now , there weren 't ways to do it without cutting down trees .
i mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water .
what 's the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale ?
on the lips . nibble the ears maybe .
but other adults say incredibly painful things .
after the facial surgery , she said , " my face now reflects my personality .
and that 's what these people can do .
she was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality .
and so they want to see live witnesses .
we put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position .
i can sprinkle a few cells , stem cells from the patient 's own hip , a little bit of genetically engineered protein , and lo and behold , leave it for four months and the face is grown .
when i took over this , i tried to really figure out , like , what my vision would be .
and the results of that are kids getting sick .
we now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers -- 2.1 million prisoners , 1.9 million farmers .
the result of which is kids think they 're going to die if they don 't have chicken nuggets .
but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart , a giraffe , a star ?
now one of the things that -- what happened when i went into berkeley is i realized that , you know , this was all pretty amazing to people , very , very different , and i needed to market it .
i work with kids a lot . these are kids i work with in harlem .
it 's sort of this " duh " thing .
that number probably needs to double .
whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids , whether you take your kids , or grandchildren , or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers ' market . just do tastings with them .
my hair used to be straight .
they all have an idea for a video game , even if they 're not experts .
that 's what we 're made of .
you 'd better leave now if you don 't want to know some of these tricks .
how many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color ?
and as i got closer and closer , i actually screamed .
how do you know that 's what you did ?
can you get it ? how many of you can 't get it ? that 'll help .
so now we 're going to be subjects in the experiment .
what i wanted to show you is that scientists , using their from-the-outside , third-person methods , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of , and that , in fact , you 're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .
they 're essentially , to a point , attempts at planning what other people should do , planning their life for them .
now , that 's also wrong , because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really , really rapidly .
but what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect , that people hated it more and more .
it 's an unfortunate reality in nearly every major city — road congestion , especially during rush hours . jonas eliasson reveals how subtly nudging just a small percentage of drivers to stay off major roads can make traffic jams a thing of the past .
these are opium-addicted people on the roofs of kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
so when you hear what i 'm going to talk about here today , first of all , i want to say that i am here on behalf of all the patients that i have ever met , all the ones i haven 't met .
and when the web came along , that changed everything , because not only could we find information , we could find other people like ourselves who could gather , who could bring us information .
so i went in for an ultrasound .
well , so what i read on webmd : " the prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer .
it 's really serious .
don 't worry about the numbers .
there 's a guy on twitter that i know , a health it guy outside boston , and he wrote the e-patient rap .
and she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray .
dave debronkart : meet e-patient dave
so what we 're doing at the moment like calcium , potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine .
and so with flight , it 's very metabolically costly .
they are the perpetrators in horror movies , such as this famous " nightwing . "
and what about the second ? what about health ?
so what we 've been doing in my lab is looking at these unique sensory specialists , the bats , and we have looked at genes that cause blindness genes that cause deafness when there 's a defect in them , and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease .
so therefore , they must have something within their dna that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses , particularly of flight . they expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size , but don 't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects .
what can we actually do ?
yes , you tear up the " eleventh commandment " -- national sovereignty .
so , here comes a bit of science , and this is a bit of science i 've done since " the bottom billion , " so it 's new .
it 's countries like nigeria , which are worse off than if they 'd never had oil .
people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue .
i realized that the reason they 're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies , politicians will get away with gestures .
but if you have to have an operation , what you really want is a minimally invasive operation .
now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the united states , sages , started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures .
i work at the cambridge hospital .
it 's a big task .
but if you happen to be sitting in beijing at the same time , by using technology in a constructive fashion , you could get it in mandarin or you could get it in russian -- on and on and on , simultaneously without the use of human translators .
laparoscopic surgery uses minimally invasive incisions -- which means less pain and shorter recovery times for patients . but steven schwaitzberg has run into two problems teaching these techniques to surgeons around the world -- language and distance . he shares how a new technology , which combines video conferencing and a real-time universal translator , could help .
returning to india to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly in madrid .
i 'm going to share two directions that are new in my work .
i got a call from a friend in phoenix .
and i know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton , but he did the calculations for our earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy .
we 're going to fly into my colleague peter 's brain .
when they control their brain , they can control their pain .
they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience , psychology , etc .
the concept of physical health is undefined .
and yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
in fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
but this is just the point .
i 've lived in the muslim world , spoken with a lot of muslim women .
sam , this is a conversation i would actually love to continue for hours .
so it 's everywhere , and we need to know how to exploit it .
no males at all .
and if this is a female , she 'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short .
in other words , what we do there , we amplify , we amplify the natural control , or the biological control phenomenon .
so the impact is very strong .
so actually , how can we do it ?
my work is so personal and so strange that i have to invent my own lexicon for it .
this is pitched into the future from 1946 , looking at the day all american families have them .
the copy , which you can 't see because it goes on and on for several pages , says that steerage passengers can 't get their to bunks before the voyage is over , and it 's so safe it carries no insurance .
this is the only fashion cover i 've ever done .
what is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have ?
are there any general conclusions that arise ?
but today , their commitment to a british identity is serving australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in asia . so it 's particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength .
and here you see just a selection .
and at the end of the food chain , we are eating them as well .
now you may say , " okay , so we 're eating 500 grams just by accident . "
but it 's increasing enormously .
we 're not taking the bonus yet .
and if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent , we 're not going to make it that way .
well they are .
md : thank you .
finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year .
some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing , or gardening .
two reasons .
if you were an educated child , you would know how to not only use the astrolabe , you would also know how to make an astrolabe .
this is the rete . okay . do you see that ?
okay , so when that happens everything lines up .
they are over 2,000 years old .
and so , what can you learn from these devices ?
it 's a constantly falling process .
and just by the tactile information , it successfully crosses over these type of terrain .
and they already had a six legged robot called lemur .
we wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .
so , this does not have any sensors .
the robots track and they team play amongst themselves .
first is : where do we get inspiration ?
so , once you do this , it is amazing how the students open up .
there you go . thank you so much .
it is the poorest county in the state .
he started some of the country 's first charter schools in the late ' 80s in the u.s.
so the goal became , yes , to apply design within education , but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development .
so this is mr. perry . he 's the assistant superintendent .
and in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely .
what design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom .
there 's no other cause .
now , the environments like you see here , dusty environments in africa where i grew up , and i loved wildlife , and so i grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing .
take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here , and i promise you , you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it 's just covered with litter , plant litter .
there is only one option , i 'll repeat to you , only one option left to climatologists and scientists , and that is to do the unthinkable , and to use livestock , bunched and moving , as a proxy for former herds and predators , and mimic nature .
it 's fine .
i can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet , for your children , and their children , and all of humanity .
so when i heard these two things , it troubled me deeply , both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons .
that 's an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos .
the next obvious question to ask : what is the process of recovery ?
patient : these are two things .
and that 's what we 're trying to do .
when we saw that , we asked : could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath , of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism ?
i was amputated at age one , and i 've been running like hell ever since , all over the place .
you were all over the place .
and no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level .
am : no , a year .
" oh , aimee , we 'll have to get back to you on that one . "
if i had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ?
and i had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he 'd come in with foot injuries .
and i was a guinea pig , as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out .
they do amazing stuff with silicon .
for instance , just recently the motion picture association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft .
and some people think that string theory is tough .
yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history .
what is math ?
we 've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that i could ever imagine with computers .
it 's a major subject .
she enjoys making what she calls " paper laptops . "
and problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this .
we want people who can feel the math instinctively .
how many years of protection do i need ?
safely reaching the other side , i turned to the left , pushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal , and waited my turn .
he was 36 . i was seven at the time .
similarly , just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space .
it 's a perfectly great city .
if you 're blind , you don 't drive .
and , more than that , whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth .
i decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the bible literally , without picking and choosing .
i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing , and incredibly challenging .
he was actually an elderly man , mid-70s , just so you know .
i would wager that their iq is exactly the same as the average evolutionist .
so , i spent time with evangelical christians , and hasidic jews , and the amish .
so the key is to choose the right rituals , the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed .
it was such a radical change , in fact , that the early macintosh development team in ' 82 , ' 83 , ' 84 had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up .
so what happens if you start to explain space to them ?
it projects down digital shadows , as you see here .
and it 's fun to fly through mr. beckett 's eye .
so , from there to the world of real work .
kevin , can you help ?
we can 't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start .
ju : that 's a good question , and we ask ourselves that every day .
and that , that maneuver called " crisis mapping , " was kicked off in kenya in january of 2008 .
and it 's those two things together -- ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts -- that are the new design resource .
and deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior : if you want somebody to do less of something , add a punishment and they 'll do less of it .
and critically , the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did .
what 's going to make the difference here is what dean kamen said , the inventor and entrepreneur .
so , the match was ended in between .
but there was another big date .
the pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder .
america is a home of leagues . and they said , " right , we 'll build some glitzy leagues here in india . "
now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot -- if mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they needn 't go to kalbadevi or shivaji park or somewhere to source them , they could go to trinidad .
and then of course there was shah rukh playing the kolkata crowd .
then andrew flintoff came by from england , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , " for four weeks , i 'm earning more than frank lampard and steven gerrard , and i 'm earning more than the footballers , wow . "
if you want to take the game around the world , it 's got to be the shortest form of the game .
you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads .
when was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was , " boy dies of asthma ? "
leroy has nine tickets ; there 's one left .
here 's a $ 2,000 hawaiian vacation package ; it 's now on sale for 1,600 .
in one case , it had a u.s. president on it ; in the other case it didn 't .
they 're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them .
you 've all had this experience .
well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
and these are subjective values , and what you can see is , our two rules are preserved .
i tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people 's psychological reaction to a set of events , and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified , rather than -- not rather than , but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we 're all concerned about .
i mean , this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it , shall i say , as those of us who have not had many terror attacks .
my guess is that there 's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past . but rather , if you 're looking for an evolutionary explanation , you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is , they 're a little scared of stuff that 's new and different .
aubrey de grey : my name 's aubrey de grey , from cambridge .
once i realized that i could take some liberties with the subject , i did the following series of drawings .
and so he did .
now , it doesn 't look terribly interesting , but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters .
actually , i realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition .
but i was absolutely stuck on the idea of " art is " and trying to determine what art was .
in fact , it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless , but as a poison , it was the best money could buy , so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands .
and plainly showed disgust at its softness , whilst i felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — — though his hands did not appear dirty . "
the way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust .
let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted . we asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups , and we either made the room smell gross or not .
the previous speaker has , i think , really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me , and my sense of loss , and trying to find the answer to the big questions .
i have this feeling i 'd be happy there .
boy : what 's that supposed to mean ?
director 2 : can you not shut up ?
again , this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was , again , the time of multiculturalism in the united kingdom , and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say , what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people ?
amphetamines .
i 'm interested .
i am 15 or 16 . i don 't remember .
e : so you are a liar .
the book starts like this . this is the cover .
when the wind is blowing , any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery .
when i was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and i decided to make water .
i 've never really gone out looking for work .
when i can predict or plan it , i don 't do it .
fg : that will be finished in 2003 -- september , october -- and i 'm hoping kyu , and herbie , and yo-yo and all those guys come play with us at that place .
i tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn 't pan out .
you can come to the opening . i 'll invite you .
rsw : this is the computer building ?
they 're hiring them to get it done , get it on budget , be polite , and they 're missing out on the real value of an architect .
fg : so , i got up .
and what would you do ? it 's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important , and really reflect on the world around us .
and i think one of the things i also wanted to say in my thanks , which i kind of missed , was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in .
that if we keep putting things , through industrial and urban existence , back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on .
in fact , when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago , they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning .
this is the town hall for the city .
the next round comes in . it 's an incredible workforce that 's building there . shanghai -- i 'm looking at the urban renewal in shanghai , and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years .
and one of the things in this picture that i wanted to point out is that when i saw these kinds of buildings , i was shocked to see that they 're not using a central air-conditioning system ; every window has an air conditioner in it .
in this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw ; this is a shot of it .
i think mobile phone companies are popping up , literally , on a weekly basis , and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones .
so that 's the photographs that i wanted to show you .
and what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text , and the text is blasted all over .
and i think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way , and starts to teach them . they know about recycling now , but they don 't really , i think , get sustainability in all the things , and the energy footprint , and how that matters .
the more stuff that 's mine , the better .
plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
and it 's not fair , it 's not safe and it 's not sustainable .
it certainly doesn 't cost as much as oil , and it 's plentiful , as i hope that you 've been able to see from the photographs .
we then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
but of course , there 's a second observation about the human species that i want to focus on a little bit more , and that 's the fact that even though we 're actually really smart , sometimes uniquely smart , we can also be incredibly , incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making .
we 'd actually just say , okay , let 's figure out the kinds of technologies we can 't deal with , the kinds of environments that are bad -- get rid of those , design things better , and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be .
my students and i got very excited about this a few years ago .
but very quickly , the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food .
the salesmen were students from my lab .
the monkeys entered the market , spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else .
most people say , why should i be risky when i can get 1,500 dollars for sure ?
so we think of things as , " oh , i 'm going to get more , " or " oh , i 'm going to get less . "
sometimes the monkeys get two extra .
so what does all of this mean ?
you can 't just look at the dessert cart as say , " no , no , no . that looks disgusting to me . "
this is my grandfather .
that 's 40 percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next 20 years .
wood is the only major material building material i can build with that actually does both those two things .
it 's hard to start them on fire , and when they do , they actually burn extraordinarily predictably , and we can use fire science in order to predict and make these buildings as safe as concrete and as safe as steel .
the reason we picked it is because this is a technical university , and i believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material i can build with .
i came in to become the head of open government , to take the values and the practices of transparency , participation and collaboration , and instill them into the way that we work , to open up government , to work with people .
what comes the day after the arab spring ?
there 's so many examples i could have picked , and i selected this one of jon bon jovi . some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in new jersey , where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans .
what it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information .
we must open up our institutions , and like the leaf , we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic , throughout our culture , to create open institutions to create a stronger democracy , a better tomorrow .
and so , i came to think that mama eternal , mama eternal , is always wondering : are all the children in ?
now that 's compassion .
that 's a picture . compassion ? i think i see it .
and he said , " here , this is the initial investment , but if needs continue , make sure that you provide them .
i close with this song -- it 's a children 's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal .
the vietnam protests , the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of aids , the march for women 's reproductive rights , right up until almost the present .
architects love to hate it .
it has to be ephemeral . it has to be formless .
this pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state .
and we said , well the first erection would take one week .
and i come from a long way .
but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head .
next was i , but jesus heard my cry .
it 's like i 'm living a dream .
and so the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love doesn 't see a color .
and i said , " no stop until we get it . "
so in order to do that , i founded a charter called gua africa , where we put kids in school .
emmanuel jal : the music of a war child
and the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen . the lawyers might file a clemency petition , they might initiate even more complex litigation , or they might not do anything at all .
now that 's really good compared to the mid 1980s , when it was in excess of 80 percent , but we can 't explain the decline in death sentences and the affinity for life without the possibility of parole by an erosion of support for the death penalty , because people still support the death penalty .
the way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger .
there are other states that do that , but we don 't .
it was the day that he was going to be executed , and we were just talking .
now , i had heard this phrase , " age of reason , " before .
there 's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence : our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit , and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment , this humiliation of rejection by santa , who was jolly -- but , let 's face it , he was also very judgmental .
the virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair , sort of lounging by some water , but the libra poster is just a huge scale .
now , apparently in jerusalem in 600 bc , everyone was completely bad and evil . every single one of them : man , woman , child , infant , fetus .
what is this wonderful gift god gave women , i wondered ?
well , that would have been much different , i think i would have instantly answered , " yes , yes , i feel it all the time . i feel god 's love when i 'm hurt and confused , and i feel consoled and cared for . i take shelter in god 's love when i don 't understand why tragedy hits , and i feel god 's love when i look with gratitude at all the beauty i see . "
what would it be like to be improving the human lot ?
it 's not nearly as important as health .
it 's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .
what 's going on there ?
it 's half a human lifetime away .
and why do i hear that ?
do you notice what 's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge ?
human beings want to be happy .
and if that person is in need , if that person is suffering , we 're automatically prepared to help . at least that 's the argument .
at any rate , at one point my brother-in-law , leonard , decided to write a book about a serial killer .
and it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt .
thank you very much .
i wanted to go from where i was to where i wanted to be , for which i needed something .
durga , the mother goddess , the fearless one , created by the pantheon of hindu gods .
time flies .
it 's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then .
well , documents you read , ok ?
data is relationships .
let 's think about data for a bit .
audience : raw .
scientists are totally stymied at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems .
that 's how linked data works .
some people don 't . and if we like them , we 've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward .
i mean , wouldn 't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this , given that we can ?
our world leaders , our global politics , currently can 't get it done .
creatively , we 've failed to communicate this success so far .
" oh , he 's bad at studies , but let him send to the drawing competitions . "
so here are some of the works i would like to show you .
how many of you saw a cow crossing in india while you were coming from bangalore to mysore ?
so what we conceive as a meaning is always not there ; it 's on the other side , even when we say dark , light , good , bad , tall , short -- all meaning it doesn 't exist in reality .
they never wrote back to me .
don 't you think it remained something about death , " they said .
because , as a visual artist , if i 'm seeing this and i 'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this , you know ?
and what i 'd like to tell you , our senses are so limited -- we cannot hear everything , we cannot see everything .
pick a percentage in your own mind .
second , these are pretty large errors . for four quantities whose average value is less than 10 percent , you have people guessing three , four times that level .
something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers , all political barriers , all geographic barriers , because at this point i know you aren 't allowed to ask me questions , but when i get to this point in my lecture with my students , hands go up , and people ask me , " yeah , but what about facebook ? "
if you look at the oecd countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person , and compare it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries , the ratio — branko milanovic at the world bank did the calculations — turns out to be about 30,000 to one .
it 's a weekly turnaround of production .
the marketing is , the bigger a brand , the more difficult it is to reposition it .
it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .
it makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force , which is ultimately good for your brand .
luckily , all of this changed a couple of centuries later .
of course , there are the bases , which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run , which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm , at least for the guy .
that 's just not the way it happens .
" not so much , i 'm kind of a mushroom guy myself . "
well , in pizza , we 're not really -- there 's no winning . how do you win pizza ?
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted ; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped .
you 're up all night . you 're walking till dawn .
and , indeed , these people would say " yes ! "
it keeps bothering you a little bit , like being hungry .
in short , we 're really moving forward to the past .
even in places like india and japan , where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market , they 're moving into journalism .
and i say , " why do you think more men are adulterous than women ? "
it may decline some more .
over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the united states .
why you and i are alike , why the iraqis and the japanese and the australian aborigines and the people of the amazon river are all alike .
and sure enough -- i 've never been in one , but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it 's crazy and it 's noisy and it 's exciting .
i brought some for her parents .
this is called fuel partitioning in the lingo .
so now , when insulin says to a cell , i want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe , the cell , in effect , says , " no thanks , i 'd actually rather store this energy . "
what if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong ?
i know it 's tempting to want an answer right now , some form of action or policy , some dietary prescription -- eat this , not that — but if we want to get it right , we 're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription .
by birth and by choice , i 've been involved with the auto industry my entire life , and for the past 30 years , i 've worked at ford motor company .
but my great grandfather , henry ford , really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people 's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them .
i mean , i think most people in the industry understand that we 've got to get on with it .
so you can see the size of the issue that we 're facing .
now if you look at hong kong , they have a very interesting system called octopus there .
now i know we can develop the technology that 's going to make this work , but we 've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven 't even thought of yet ; our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure must support all the future options .
thank you .
6 : 20 .
things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient 's room so that it signified , " this is my room . this is my personal space " -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem .
and they had this vision of the nurse , kind of , clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly , sort of , gadget-lustish .
this is people designing their own experiences .
they live around things , and so their spatial awareness relationship , and their thinking around storage is totally different .
so what seems like a very clunky product is , in fact , incredibly useful .
so , the question is , why only them ?
but we had parents who said , " okay , making our children good human beings is all very well , but what about math and science and english ?
and ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .
in the future , i will never doubt my students ' abilities .
last i heard , the preamble still said , " we , the people of india , " right ?
they were filled with a kind of pioneering passion , fired about the problems of the aral sea .
buildings are important , but they 're only a component of a much bigger picture .
in other words , if you put onto the roads , as is currently happening , 1,000 new cars every day -- statistically , it 's the biggest booming auto market in the world -- and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing .
this building was wired for change .
so if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in germany , and here you can see the guy with his computer screen , and those points in space are communicated .
going back in time , there was a lady called valerie larkin , and in 1987 , she had all our information on one disk .
and finally , you profile this , you cut grooves into it .
hong kong i refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age , because you always have a point of reference .
and here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings -- the chapel notre dame du haut , ronchamp -- where he creates this light that he could only make because there 's also dark .
it can be just like this , or maybe like this , which is rather peculiar , but this is in 1963 -- the viewing of a sun eclipse in the united states .
richard kelly saw it as something infinite , something without any focus , something where all details actually dissolve in infinity .
but when you look at this planet at night , it looks like this .
so i asked our laboratory to do something about it , and they said , " well , we can do something . "
or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around ?
but i also think of peter zumthor 's spa in vals , where light and dark , in very gentle combinations , alter each other to define the space .
is it that i articulate very well ?
or of indian councils of science research do not require that whatever you learn from people , you must share back with them .
we should be doing something about it .
and it all begins with curiosity .
obviously she 's an artist ; she 's a creative person .
you bring your water , you bring your soap , i wash the clothes for you . charge 50 paisa , one rupee for you per lot , and a new business model can emerge .
now , let me mention one thing : i think we need a polycentric model of development , where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country , in different parts of the world , would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner .
new inventions are the passion of my life .
and this person , mr. ubirajara .
now , this lady , she used to do the winding of the yarn for pochampally saree .
that 's reassuring .
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities .
i mean , what are we fighting over right now ?
we 're a recreational vehicle that doesn 't really matter , and i don 't spend my time doing that kind of stuff .
and it suddenly occurred to me , that among my many fears , were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that , fundamentally , you believe there 's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left , the sidewalks in these cities .
this little beast , right now , is producing a few hundred watts of electricity .
but apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed .
and so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died .
now , as a business professor , and as any business professor would tell you , an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure , good incentives , a solid identity and good brand management .
their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement , so they invest heavily in providing local services , like dealing with home violence , going after petty criminals , treating addicts , and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are , and , of course , protecting people from other criminal organizations .
and so , differences aside , what these three organizations share is on the one hand , a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top , but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time .
you 've probably seen something like this before .
the dvd , as you know , was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive . but you can see that by 1998 , it had fallen below 400 dollars , and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold .
start with gene sequencing .
that is , i imagine , what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about .
free is probably the most interesting thing .
because of the resources , the skills , and certainly the surge of talent we 're seeing all around the world , with the mindset to create change .
it 's money that 's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare , water , housing , alternative energy , thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity , but as individual customers , consumers , clients , people who want to make decisions in their own lives .
the drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre , even if he had two , because it was too frightening , given all that he had at stake .
because we 're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people . all of the ones i discussed have reached at least a quarter million people .
and we left karachi one morning before dawn .
the time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions , a cross sector , is now .
if you looked in the book , you saw this , which i really was appalled by .
i was an english major in college . i didn 't have any use for it , but i missed writing . so , i started to write a blog and i started to create things like these little stories .
how much money does he spend on beer in a year ?
one story is about this baby , and his name is odin .
but then you also find people 's blogs , and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic , but things that interest them .
this is the only picture i have . and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs ; to think about the people who are on those $ 100 computers talking about who they are , sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing .
and this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship , and flattening this sort of world .
they 're on coins that date back 3,000 years .
it 's the 21st century , but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way .
behind the scenes is a working lab at stanford university partnered with the monterey bay aquarium .
and then with a lot of effort , after tagging , putting in the computer , making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment , we send this fish back into the sea .
the warm is the gulf stream , the cold up there in the gulf of maine .
so what we 've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in alaska , met salmon shark on their home territory , followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that , if we take a salmon and put it on a line , we can actually take up a salmon shark -- this is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note , i say " very carefully , " -- we can actually keep it calm , put a hose in its mouth , keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag .
but now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small , we can actually see these journeys .
we just need to put it together .
and i had a little bit of a problem a few years ago .
just assorted garage sale junk , because i 'm a pack rat . "
so i was like , " maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly . "
then i 'd make websites .
i was certainly not thinking , hey , i got new work here .
this is a parking lot in elko , nevada off of route 80 at 8 : 01 p.m. on august 19th .
and on sunday , june 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o 'clock in the afternoon in skowhegan , maine -- this was my apartment there .
so in a way , i 'm glad that i 'm completely obsolete .
you said , " now everything automatically goes from my iphone , " but actually you do take the pictures and put on information .
more than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century watchhouse he lives in with his cat , squeak .
now , this little anecdote gets to the heart of why i 'm really passionate about collaborative consumption , and why , after i finished my book , i decided i 'm going to try and spread this into a global movement .
now the way taskrabbit works is , people outsource the tasks that they want doing , name the price they 're willing to pay , and then vetted rabbits yes , there 's actually a four-stage , rigorous interview process that 's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy rabbits .
now , i know what you might be thinking .
i envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you , when , where and why , your reliability on taskrabbit , your cleanliness as a guest on airbnb , the knowledge that you display on quora or [ unclear ] , they 'll all live together in one place , and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your reputation capital .
people are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built .
and it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
and there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i 've just shown you , which i shall use over and over again in the data .
i may say , we did all this work twice .
here we have children dropping out of high school .
japan is rather different though .
more to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority , of being valued and devalued , respected and disrespected .
correlation in itself doesn 't prove causality .
despite the advanced technology , it 's not reaching the people who need it most .
and we 've been able to develop a knee , a polycentric knee , so that type of knee that acts like a human knee , mimics human gait , for 80 dollars retail .
and at d-rev , we go one step further and we say you need to be user-obsessed .
and this goes into my last point .
krista donaldson : the $ 80 prosthetic knee that 's changing lives
and there 's very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there 's a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
i mean , it 's just wonderful .
is that a good way to play ping-pong ?
it 's round , it 's neat .
and , basically , none of them could solve it .
or the 1963 jaguar : it 's actually a crummy car , falls apart all the time , but the owners love it .
that 's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back , and you put tea in , and then you fill it with water .
if you want a more positive model -- this is the gm car .
and if i succeed in doing that , maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on , and perhaps help me do my work .
so it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools , as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat , and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing . it appears that way .
and what we did over there was pretty much simple .
so we thought that this is what was happening : that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the internet . but under what circumstances ?
so i did this for almost five years , and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of india .
so , how do they do that ?
so i leave you with this third question .
sugata mitra : kids can teach themselves
and i , one day , i announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- i said , " daddy , i want to be a diplomat . "
and anyway , my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time .
and indeed , our own internal assessment was very clear that iraq 's wmd did not pose a threat to its neighbors , let alone to us .
a lot of my friends were still in it .
she said , " why don 't you advise the kosovars ?
and it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ? what if ! , which some of you have probably heard of .
we have no choice but to embrace that reality .
super-logical , you would think .
so what i want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it .
and they walk out from behind the counter and they 've got no pants on .
this is an error page , but what if this error page was also an opportunity ?
how do these nielsen ratings reflect not just what you 've heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea how does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
so to our global ted audiences , i want to say that this was a u.s. sample .
take a look at this .
the 70s means who ? norman lear .
but look : x marks the spot .
the 1980s , our first cougar was given to us in the form of alexis carrington .
i have no idea what to do next .
but that 's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria .
so we have this field of science that 's all about slime , and color changes . check this out .
and you 're like , " actually , shut up !
leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point .
he collected all kinds of case studies .
i 'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by glenn gray .
durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of e pluribus unum , of making a group out of individuals .
now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years , but it 's about to make a major comeback this year , especially after e.o. wilson 's book comes out in april , making a very strong case that we , and several other species , are products of group selection .
it takes advantage of the others .
and the most cohesive hives won , just as darwin said .
those things came along too recently .
most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger .
here is one of the first spaces i found . it is in austin , texas , which is where i 'm from .
all the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed .
i actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal , and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work , unlike powerpoint and some other programs .
yet it doesn 't say that ; it doesn 't need to say that .
it 's not a matter of teaching it ; in fact , most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can 't quantify it : it 's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design , but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter .
" the invention of printing did away with anonymity , fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property , " which had never been done before printing .
i don 't have the site . it 's just the piece itself .
so , we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative : their over-competitiveness , their , you know , long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it .
having done a lot of magazines , i 'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories , and i was very curious to see how time and newsweek would handle 9 / 11 .
we are wrapping up .
but , you know , the government would make a plane ; they 'd say , go see if that one flies , would you ?
and i 'm not even sure we know what technology is .
so that 's where i want to begin my little exploration , is in life .
and if we take the long-term trends of life , if we begin to say , what does evolution want ? there 's several things that we see .
so we 're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things .
and this is a website of a guy who 's selling brand new parts for the stanley automobile . and the thing that i liked is sort of this one-click , add-to-your-cart button -- -- for buying steam valves . i mean , it was just -- it was really there .
it 's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas .
we want a trillion zillion species of one individuals .
and the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes , birds of every flavor .
so i was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away , and at that time i could actually focus that close ; now as i look at my fuzzy fingers i realize those days are long gone .
and there 's a beautiful reef , very complex reef , with lots of animals , including a lot of octopus .
if you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen , and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen , get in a sub .
and all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life .
and you show up , and it 's dead .
i 'm an individual . i 'm one person .

film producer jeff skoll talks about his film company , participant productions , and the people who 've inspired him to do good .
where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff ?
because it 's scary and it 's expensive , but we need to have it , ok ?
equipment that 's obsolete , equipment that doesn 't quite work , or it works and you can 't fix it . and there 's nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .

and their decisions about software coding , engineering , design , terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives .
so we assume that the internet is a border-busting technology .
we don 't necessarily always do it very well , but we have a sense of what the models are , politically and institutionally , to do that .
these are grim economic times , fellow tedsters , grim economic times indeed .

sir david attenborough , he 's come over .
i can tell you that in three words .
but he explained to me that he was in a bind , and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for -- so i said fine , ted -- i mean chris . i 'll come on two conditions .
mark serfaas . it 's pretty cool , huh ? pursuing happiness .
by monday , over a million people were coming to this site a day .
and i gotta say that , you know , it 's really , really great to be here .
and chris had said in an email that , you know , we should really bring something new to ted , something that we haven 't shown anyone .
in other words , it 's a helping tool .
but what you 're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out .
it 's a letter .
most of the time , if they have an exit strategy , they should take it .

but i 'm going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we 've been talking about .
and what happened was , because they could afford it sometimes , sometimes not , i got kicked out pretty much every term .
my father , who i 've been talking about , died of aids in 1999 .
and , you know , now , imagine if -- and i could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me .
blogging is one way of doing that .
you know , just jump .
you 're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart .
my sister was struggling to get through undergrad .
like , that 's the dumbest reason i 've ever heard for applying to law school .
i know what i have just said is simply not obvious .
many were touched by my personal story , and they shared their stories in return .
themes have included runs for the environment , breast cancer , for the love of lebanon , for peace , or just simply to run .

my mom is a pediatrician , and i asked her .
but , but it didn 't work .
and by the time i 'm done , in 2020 , when the who publishes the data again , this is going to be the map of anemia .

and then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well .
and yet , why should there be so much variation in quality and in service , and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems .
we designed a van with a vsat , which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed , and then as the patient is waiting , the report goes back to the patient , it gets printed out , the patient gets it , and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing -- i mean , go see a doctor or come back after six months , and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence .
we created competition for ourselves , and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables .

and by the way , the assumption that we can safely control the earth 's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat , making the planet not too hot , not too cold , but just right -- sort of goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy , and it 's not coming from the climate scientists .
whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them , our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature -- the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer , the narrative of manifest destiny , the narrative of apocalypse and salvation .
i believe that we know this , yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop .
then , you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand .
think of it as the ultimate junk shot .
dh : thank you .
dh : perfect .
rw : in all past years i 've rehearsed with them , the things that have happened to me -- i have no idea what 's going to happen and that 's the truth .
rw : do you want me to hold you or not ? dh : don 't hold me that hard .
impossible , you say ?
bf : yeah , it 's all right .
all right , get up ! come on and dance ! dh : dance , come on . bf : come on and dance !
bf : richard you tell him , it 's your last year .
what pearl of wisdom ?
it was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers .

you need accessories you 're going to come with .
rather than just being a programmer , she saw something that babbage didn 't .
so , where does that bring us today ?
so what do i have to do ?

we 're only trying to improve our lives .
chromosome one , top left .
world population , pc placements , the archive of all the medical literature , moore 's law , the old way of sequencing , and here 's all the new stuff .
so unfortunately , this doesn 't help this woman , but it does have severe , profound if you will , implications to her family .
so the theory is that he 's having some immunological reaction to what 's going on to the food essentially , and that 's a natural reaction , which causes some programmed cell death .
and i was required to answer : a. i have never had a genetic test , b. i 've had one , here you go , and c. i 've had one and i 'm not telling .
not hard to imagine . my company has software that does this right now .
and the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue , and kind of punch it into the hard bone , into the tuchus -- that 's a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out , each time , with a syringe .
here is a live patient . you can see it following the flexible curves around .
these polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors .
that 's quantum mechanics .
these familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations , which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses .
the electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge , which make this pattern .
when we include these , each matter particle has two different spin charges , spin-up and spin-down .
they sit on top of one another in the standard charge space .
i believe this to be true , and i 've tried to follow galileo 's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles , circles and other geometrical figures .
for most of the past ten years i 've lived on the island of maui , a very beautiful place .
and that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see .
and i want to pick up with my talk this evening from where zeray left off yesterday .
chimpanzees don 't have a spoken language . we 've talked about that .
there isn 't time to go into it , but it 's including things like tree nurseries , methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded , almost desert-like land up in these mountains .
and when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile , particularly when you cut down trees , and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion , as desperate populations cut down more and more trees , so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families , what 's going to happen ? something 's got to give .
and when the rain does come , it so often leads to flooding and added distress , and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease .
so one of their projects will be to help their own human community .
and i mean , think of the technologies .
and animals , almost on the brink of extinction , can be given a second chance . that 's my next book .
it 's ephemeral just like us . "
you put something in a bin and you don 't have to think about it again .
or when you go to the supermarket and you 're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers , you don 't take out your cell phone , and open a browser , and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make .
and , as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he 's picking up , using either image recognition or marker technology , and give him the green light or an orange light .
this demo -- from pattie maes ' lab at mit , spearheaded by pranav mistry -- was the buzz of ted . it 's a wearable device with a projector that paves the way for profound interaction with our environment . imagine " minority report " and then some .
and i saw phyllis , and i watched her .
pr : i would like to say that i have learned so much from aicha , starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security , because it was november 2002 , and , frankly , we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members .
you have to fight against violence .
the days and weeks that followed , people fleeing to the hills , being forced to drink contaminated water or face death .
so -- someone 's done that up .
give it a few pumps . okay ?
the problem just becomes self-perpetuating .
with 20 billion dollars , everyone can have access to safe drinking water .
we have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of greece passed to rome and the power shifts that occurred during the european civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different .
it will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty-based systems , treaty-based agreements , to govern that global space .
and you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in china , of course , though my own guess is that china 's ascent to greatness is not smooth .
now we have to call in others .
you get swine flu in mexico , it 's a problem for charles de gaulle airport 24 hours later .
if it is the case , ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before , then it 's also the case that we share a destiny with each other .
so the premise of blue zones : if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity .
we are programmed for something called procreative success .
but life expectancy in this country is only 78 .
that 's called the grandmother effect .
it 's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [ 80 ] percent full .
they instantly knew why they woke up in the morning .
they take their diet directly from the bible .
she rides her bicycle .
the sardinians pray . the seventh-day adventists pray .
but when you think about it , your friends are long-term adventures , and therefore , perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life , and life to your years . thank you very much .
so i 'm a social scientist by training , so why am i here today talking about smart materials ?
another example i 'd like to mention is hannah perner-wilson 's kit-of-no-parts .
so what happens ?
and usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road .
you can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave .
and you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way .
so when i had the chance to give the world 's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity , it was incredible .
well , we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this .
we are living on a precious jewel , and it 's during our lifetime that we 're moving off this planet .
and these micro-machines really are at the heart of life .
so no matter how lazy you feel , you 're not really intrinsically doing nothing .
i showered in campgrounds . i ate out regularly .
i hadn 't changed . my i.q. hadn 't dropped .
i was a writer .
but we began with a family-planning program , following a very successful maternal child health activity , sets of activities .
wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women , selling things -- here 's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people , you 'll find contraceptives in thailand .
in thailand , for poor people , diamonds don 't make it -- so the condom is the girl 's best friend .
in all this thing , from seven children to 1.5 children , population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5 .
so they were happy with that .
we found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction , but we have found the weapon of mass protection : the condom .
because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit .
that 's the difference .
so a couple .
so i can see everything that romo sees , and i get a robot 's-eye-view of the world .
that girl can take her iphone , put it on the robot , send an email to grandma , who lives on the other side of the country .
your smartphone may feel like a friend -- but a true friend would give you a smile once in a while . at ted2013 , keller rinaudo demos romo , the smartphone-powered mini robot who can motor along with you on a walk , slide you a cup of coffee across the table , and react to you with programmable expressions .
those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games .
but so did most of the flag-bearers , except sophia loren , the universal symbol of beauty and passion .
we can call this place in congo a death camp , because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation .
they have no control over their bodies or their lives .
the next morning , when she comes again to the so-called clinic , her first patient is waiting for her with her husband .
in any war today , most of the casualties are civilians , mainly women and children . they are collateral damage .
yes , i would love to have sophia loren 's long legs and legendary breasts .
they 're not being really strategic at all .
there 's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis , because they 're picking zero or one .
okay . get ready .
but we 're interested in , can we say something about when disagreements occur versus don 't occur ?
and then later there 's activity in the uninformed brain .
wrong .
game theoretically , that should actually make the mismatcher 's behavior shift , because what happens is , the mismatcher will think , oh , this guy 's going to go for the big reward , and so i 'm going to go to the right , make sure he doesn 't get it .
we live in places like this as if they 're the most natural things in the world , forgetting that because we 're animals and that we need to eat , we 're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were .
as we 're moving into cities , the world is also embracing a western diet .
and , in fact , you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one long , drawn out militarized shopping spree , really .
but also you have to imagine it full of food .
now it 's anonymous .
it can either mean a good place , or no place .
this is basically bringing the whole thing together .
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
the task of our time , one of the great tasks of our time , is to build a global society , as i said , where people can live together in peace .
you also have to do it .
and we learn to live together and to get to know one another .
so i 'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and i at mit are working on to achieve this self-assembling future .
and so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build .
that 's amazing parallel and distributed computing power , new design possibilities .
and he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria , at the time .
and even in the relatively sterile blood , around one to two percent of this information is dark matter -- can 't be classified , can 't be typed or matched with anything we 've seen before .
and the idea there is that outside the spaceship , the universe is implacably hostile , and inside is all we have , all we depend on .
and yet from intergalactic space , it 's so far away you wouldn 't even see it .
now how does the solar system -- and our environment , in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe ?
probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back .
now the lesson of that seems clear to me , and i don 't know why it isn 't informing public debate .
let 's give him a name , too : nelson .
but if we can find ways to give more choices to both , that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps .
income there stayed stagnant , as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world .
on the other hand , the nation is too big .
in some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility , a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities .
many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .
what university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual .
paul romer : why the world needs charter cities
for example , it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments .
and we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to richard dawkins ' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view , which are different constructs of these gene components .
this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware , and that 's the notions that we have with biology .
after these genomes are synthesized , the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome .
thank you very much .
they cannot wait . the others , of course , wait .
cost-benefit analysis .
and they live for work , achievement and control .
or this ?
and if nasa doesn 't do it , china might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
and it is a body that has long intrigued people who 've watched the planets .
we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere , and my camera system is one of them .
it was an unambiguous pattern , a geological pattern .
there 's hundreds , up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes .
and i don 't think i need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system , whether it be on enceladus or elsewhere , would have enormous cultural and scientific implications .
so i 'm here today to talk about the power of attention , the power of your attention , and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank , gaza and elsewhere -- but today , my case study is going to be palestine .
it 's like fallujah . shooting everywhere .
in the course of taking my film to villages in the west bank , in gaza and in east jerusalem , i have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation .
millions of people were in severe need of help .
welcome to the new world .
and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town .
and place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell .
and grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space .
as it turns out , there 's a pattern .
